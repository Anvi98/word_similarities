@@4000241 I think it is safe to say that ours is the only dining room in West Los Angeles on whose table -- an eight-foot-long , two-hundred-pound behemoth on which I have taken my meals for many years -- rest piles of photocopies of articles on suicide , all of which were printed in the Encyclopaedia Britannica over the past 220 years . They represent the convergence of two crucially important strands in my own life . Indeed , as I look at the articles , arrayed before me in fanlike tiers , I get the odd feeling that the old oak ruble on which I have eaten so many thousands of dinners has been set not with its customary china and silver but with my intellectual autobiography . <p> My special relationship with the Britannica is of long standing . It is relevant to report that I was a sickly child and stayed home from school a great deal . The reader can readily imagine the sort of boy I was : frail , bookish , and undersized ( I was small to begin with , and continued to shrink , comparatively speaking , as I was double-promoted four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Our house , fifteen miles and seventy years from the one in which my wife and I live today , resembled those of many Eastern European Jewish immigrant families with intellectual aspirations . There were copies of Shakespeare , Tolstoy , Dostoyevsky , Conrad , and Mann , diligently assembled from the local Lincoln Heights Library 's list of " The 100 Best . " There was a windup Victrola and records of operatic arias sung by Caruso and Farrar . And in the center of all this -- the jewel in the Shneidman family 's cultural crown-there was the Ninth Edition of the Britannica , enshrined in a Stickley bookcase with glass doors and its own little key . The suite of Craftsman furniture to which the bookcase belonged also included a sofa , a chair , and a table . All of them are in my home today . <p> Among the happiest hours of my childhood were those spent alone at home , circa 1925 . My parents would be working in their clothing store , my brother and sister would be in school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tucked in their 1910 Grand Rapids mahogany bed between two billowy white sheets , listening to Farrar sing Gilda and reading the encyclopedia . I have little doubt that more than half of what I know today I learned from the pages of the Ninth Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica . I suspect that this accounts for my essentially nineteenth-century ideas about science . And I muse that my frenetic and nervous way of studying ( or reading or writing ) -- a lifelong habit -- could well be a happy remnant of the fact that my first earnest perusals of " The Geometry " or " Kant " were interrupted every few minutes by the need to leap out of my parents ' bed either to change the 78-rpm record or to wind the Victrola . It seems unlikely that I would so deeply love the intellectual life today had I not initially found my young mind 's independence within such a cozy and easeful setting . <p> Fast-forward to 1949 , the year that , quite by accident , I met my life 's second great strand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Brentwood Veterans Administration hospital . On that particular morning I was in the subbasement of the old Los Angeles Hall of Records , in the coroner 's vault , looking at file folders containing the records of certified deaths . The director of my hospital had asked me to prepare letters to two young widows whose husbands had recently committed suicide while they were hospital patients . My intention was to look at the two men 's folders , make some notes , and get back to work . <p> The first folder contained something I had not seen before : a genuine suicide note . The second folder did not . Who could stop at this point ? I looked at several dozen folders . It seemed that every so often I would open a folder -- about one out of every fifteen suicide folders-and find a suicide note . I did a quick count of the folders on one shelf and estimated that I was standing in a room that contained approximately two thousand suicide notes . I felt like a cowpoke who , wandering home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of oil and is just sober enough to realize he has found his fortune . <p> Had I indulged my initial urge to read the letters right there in the coroner 's vault , I might have learned a good deal about individual human tragedy , but I would have done nothing to advance the study of suicide , which was then an almost nonexistent field . Instead , in a decision that changed my life , I made photocopies of more than seven hundred genuine suicide notes and put them aside without reading them , so that my colleague Norman Farberow and I could later compare them , in blind controlled studies , with simulated suicide notes that would be elicited from nonsuicidal people . The result was the first work on suicide notes -- and indirectly on suicide itself -- that followed scientific protocols . My subsequent career -- helping to found the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center , developing a program in suicide prevention for the National Institute of Mental Health , thinking about suicide , writing about suicide -- all dates from that morning in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have been continuously intrigued by the topic of suicide and drawn to people who are on the brink of serf-destruction . I am not a suicidal person myself ; my fascination is , I suppose , partly voyeuristic and partly scientific . I have always been attracted to excitement , and few things could be more exciting than the pursuit of understanding in a virgin field that involved such strong and intimate human emotions . <p> The reader can surmise what it meant to me , a quarter century after I happened upon those suicide notes , to be invited to contribute my own seven pages of printed text , headed " Suicide , " to volume 21 of the 1973 edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica , the same set of books that once was my Testament , Koran , and Upanishads . <p> I have come close to implying that the Ninth Edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica was a kind of father figure to me . It is true that I treated those books and the information in them with a respect bordering on awe , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cathedra . At that time , all these sentiments were also true of my unquestioned attitudes toward my father . Writing my own article for the EB was a psychological landmark ; it gave me a voice of my own . I suddenly felt like Ernest Pontifex , in The Way of All Flesh , who was finally able to contravene his father without feeling that he was either destroying or betraying him . <p> Before I wrote my 1973 article , I looked at two or three earlier pieces . It did not occur to me then to view them as documents of intellectual history ; I merely wished to identify my predecessors ' pitfalls -- such as an overreliance on dreary tables of statistics -- so I could avoid stepping into them myself . I wrote the article and proudly added the Fourteenth Edition of the Britannica to the Ninth Edition that still reposed in the glass-fronted Stickley bookcase that I had inherited . Two and a half decades passed . Then , as I approached the age of eighty , I had another thought . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely to have in one 's twenties or even fifties , when the habit of looking back is not so fully developed . Why not examine the articles on suicide in all the editions since the first one , in 1768 ? <p> The idea allowed me simultaneously to become , all over again , the unformed child in a soft bed who had learned about the world from his parents ' encyclopedia , and also to read these articles on suicide -- including my own -- and see , from the emancipated vantage point of old age , their flaws , their anachronisms , their generational gaps of knowledge . If the Britannica was the most authoritative popular repository of knowledge during the various eras of its existence , would not its successive treatments of suicide reflect , in a long chronological march , our culture 's changing attitudes toward the subject that had consumed my life ? With the help of the Chicago staff of the EB , the New York Public Library , and Harvard 's Houghton Library , I assembled copies of the encyclopedia 's fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story -- the attempt , over time , to answer such crucial questions as : Is suicide a sin ? Is it a crime ? Is it the responsibility of the individual or of society ? What causes it ? Can human suffering be reduced to statistics ? How can suicide be prevented ? Should it be prevented ? And that story is what is now spread out , with my wife 's indulgence , all over our dining table . <p> The Encyclopaedia Britannica , while not the first encyclopedia -- its forerunners include the remarkable Encyclopedie ou Dictionnaire raisonne des Sciences , des Arts et des Metiers of Diderot and d'Alembert , published in France starting in 1751 -- has remained the most constant and influential . Its first edition was published in Edinburgh in 1768 . There have been fourteen editions since then , of which the Eleventh Edition , of 1910 , is generally considered the greatest . Roughly speaking , a new edition was published every ten or twenty years ( in the interim there were sometimes several printings with minor variations ) until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half century , there were only relatively modest alterations : some articles were dropped , some added , some contributors replaced . With the Fifteenth Edition , in 1974 , there was a radical restructuring of the overall format of the EB : the timehonored , strictly alphabetical arrangement was dropped in favor of a thesaurus-like approach , including a one-volume Propaedia ( an overview ) , a Micropaedia ( a comprehensive survey ) , and a Macropaedia ( topics discussed in detail ) . The latest version of the Britannica , " published " in 1994 , is on CD-ROM -- a hundred pounds of books reduced to about an ounce . <p> There was no article on suicide in the first edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica . That is understandable ; the word itself was fairly new . ( The words suicide and encyclopedia seem to have a common vintage and perhaps even a common creator . The vintage is the fifth decade of the seventeenth century , 1642 for suicide and 1646 for encyclopedia ; the creator is Sir Thomas Browne , the author of Religio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second Edition of the EB was published , it contained a memorable article called " Self-Murder . " <p> " Self-Murder " is one page long . Whatever else can be said about it , it is not dull . It jerks you awake with the first sentence , hectors and shakes you until the finish , and , at the very end , makes an unconvincing attempt to soften its Draconian stance . It has the smell of fire and brimstone , the sound of a wrathful sermon by Cotton Mather . The article begins with a beautifully expressed but horrendously cruel definition : " SELF-MURDER , the pretended heroism , but real cowardice , of the Stoic philosophers , who destroyed themselves to avoid those ills which they had not the fortitude to endure , though the attempting it seems to be countenanced by the civil law , yet was punished by the Athenian law with cutting off the hand which committed the desperate deed . " It continues in a vein that joins the religious and the legal : <p> And also the law of England wisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to destroy life but by commission from God and the author of it ; and as the suicide is guilty of a double offence ; one spiritual , in invading the prerogative of the Almighty , and rushing into his immediate presence uncalled for ; the other temporal , against the king , who hath an interest in the preservation of all his subjects ; the law has therefore ranked this among the highest crimes , making it a peculiar species of felony ; a felony committed on one 's self . <p> And it concludes with an answer to the obvious question : If the felon is dead , how can human laws punish him ? <p> They can only act upon what he has left behind him , his reputation and fortune ; on the former , by an ignominious burial in the highway , with a stake driven through his body ; or the latter , by a forfeiture of all his goods and chattels to the king , hoping that his care for either his own reputation or the welfare of his family would be some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act . . . . And tho ' it must be owned that the letter of the law herein borders a little on severity ; yet it is some alleviation , that the power of mitigation is left in the breast of the sovereign , who upon this ( as on all other occasions ) is reminded by the oath of his office , to execute judgment in mercy . <p> The last sentence strikes me as conveying the same dubious comfort as a hangman 's blessing . The anonymous author of this mean-spirited little article -- whose only mention of prevention is its approving note on the custom , prevalent at the time , of besmirching the self-murderer 's reputation and confiscating his worldly goods -- is clearly far more interested in flagellating the suicide than in keeping him alive . <p> By 1788 , when the Third Edition was published , the word suicide had gained sufficient currency to constitute the article 's title . And this time the EB had much more to say : five pages ' worth , starting with a far briefer and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the person who commits it . " The first section of the article is a historical survey of suicide among the Jews , the ancient Greeks , the Brahmins , the Hindus , the Japanese , the Scythians , the tribes of Scandinavia , and others . The tone of this report can be gathered from the paragraph on suicide among the Jews : <p> Suicide is one of those crimes which we are led to believe not common among savage nations . The first instances of it recorded in the Jewish history are those of Saul and Ahitophel ; for we do not think the death of Samson a proper example . We have no reason to suppose it became common among the Jews till their wars with the Romans , when multitudes slaughtered themselves that they might not fall alive into the hands of their enemies . But at this period the Jews were a most desperate and abandoned race of men , had corrupted the religion of their fathers , and rejected that pure system which their promised Messiah came to Jerusalem to announce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 1852 . <p> As for the causes of suicide in England , they are ascribed to " the variableness of the climate , the great use of animal food , strong spiritous liquors and to tea , and to the sulphurous exhalations of the pit-coal used as fuel . . . . We are rather surprised that coal is mentioned even as a distant cause of suicide , for it is one of the blessings of our island ; and a good coal fire we have always found rather conducive to good spirits rather than injurious to them . " It is rare to find such a cozy passage in the staid pages of the EB . <p> Having disposed of history and causation , the article moves on to the aspects that had constituted the entirety of the 1777 article : the morality and legality of suicide . It reasserts that suicide is a felo-de-se ( a felony against oneself ) , a crime against God and the king . But it ends with a sentence that indicates that the times are changing : " Suicide , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a difficult matter to find an effectual remedy . . . . Punishment will not be a preventive , even if it could be always inflicted ; and that it is seldom inflicted , though the laws have decreed it , is well known . " This Concluding emphasis on prevention , complete with a humble acknowledgment of its difficulty , sounds surprisingly modern . <p> The historical portions of this entry appeared essentially unchanged for sixty-four years in the Fourth ( 1801 ) , Fifth ( 1815 ) , Sixth ( 1820 ) , and Seventh ( 1830 ) Editions . <p> But changes were coming . The entry for " Suicide " in the Eighth Edition ( 1852-1860 ) in many ways repeats the contents of the Seventh . However , it is notable for including landmark quotations from two major nineteenth-century intellectual figures . <p> The first quotation is from Henry Thomas Buckle , chess prodigy and scientifically minded historian . Buckle believes that " the progress of every people is regulated by principles . . . as certain as those which govern the physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide rates over years and points to the folly of enacting laws against it . He states that <p> suicide is merely the product of the general condition of society , and that the individual only carries into effect what is a necessary consequence of preceding circumstance . . . thus we are able to predict within a small limit of error the number of voluntary deaths for each ensuing period , assuming , of course , that the social circumstances do not undergo marked change . <p> Buckle 's morally neutral stance , which transfers blame from the individual to his society , neatly moves suicide from the purview of religion to that of social science and presages the key role that demography was soon to play in its study . <p> The second quotation is from the great philosopher and economist John Stuart Mill . In his essay " On Liberty " -- in which he opposed any legislation that would interfere with the sale of poisons on the ground that it would exert unnecessary state control over individual freedom-he wrote ( and is quoted in the 1860 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a necessity , but only a danger of mischief , no one but the person himself can judge of the sufficience of the motive which may prompt him to incur the risk of buying poison . In this case therefore ( unless he is a child , or delirious or in some state of excitement or absorption incompatible with the full use of the reflecting faculty ) , he ought , I conceive , be only warned of the danger , not forcibly prevented from exposing himself to it . <p> This prescient paragraph contains the core arguments of current controversies and debates : Do people own their own lives ( and deaths ) , or are we as a society responsible for saving our fellows from their own errors ? <p> Mill 's libertarian voice was destined to be outshouted by the subsequent inundation of articles that concentrated on numbers rather than ethics . The Ninth Edition ( 1875-1889 ) contains a six-page article by Wynnard Hooper , a financial journalist who , tellingly , also wrote the pieces on statistics and population . ( This was the edition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remember reading this article then . ) Hooper includes five tables of European suicide statistics and one table for certain American states , and discusses these figures in terms of race , sex , climate , population density , occupations , seasons , and methods of suicide . He concludes that " it can not be said that any satisfactory result has been obtained from these investigations , owing no doubt to the fact that the phenomenon is too minute to furnish numbers large enough for the proper application of the statistical method . " His article marks a radical swing to the demographic and statistical approach , reflecting and foreshadowing the work of Morselli , Durkheim , Halbwachs , and Dublin . It cut the pattern for the next hundred years . <p> The Tenth Edition ( 1902 ) contains an unmemorable two-page article , essentially a shortened version of the article in the previous edition , by H. H. Littlejohn , a professor of forensic medicine at the University of Edinburgh . Littlejohn also wrote the article on suicide in the great Eleventh Edition of 1910 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like Buckle and Hooper , Littlejohn regards suicide as " a sign of the presence of maladies in the body politic which deserve careful consideration . " He asserts that " suicide as a whole conforms to certain general laws , and is influenced by conditions other than mere individual circumstances or surroundings . " His article , mainly concerned with British suicide statistics for the 1880s and 1890s , was repeated in the Twelfth ( 1921 ) and Thirteenth ( 1926 ) Editions . <p> The article on suicide in the Fourteenth Edition ( 1929-1940 ) went through numerous versions in different printings . The first , in 1929 , was a two-page article by S. de Jastrzebski , the assistant registrar general of Great Britain , that included updated figures for sex and age and for methods of suicide in England and Wales as well as an interesting and highly topical section on the " Influence of the World War " : <p> The following figures for 1911-1914 , 1915-1918 , 1921-1925 , relating as they do to nine of the belligerent countries and two non-belligerents closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt the profound effect produced upon the suicide-rate by the World War . . . . In every case the war period is marked by a notable decline in the suicide-rate . To the theory that nervous strain is one of the prime causes which lead to self-destruction , they give a complete and emphatic contradiction . <p> The 1955-1961 printings of the Fourteenth Edition contained a short piece by Ruth S. Cavan , an American sociologist , which was perhaps the most succinct and most comprehensive to date . Within the compass of a single page , it includes pithy paragraphs on a variety of subtopics : international comparisons ; age , sex , and marital conditions ; urban-rural rates ; methods of suicide ; suicide and other means of violent death ; and interpretations . Cavan concludes : <p> Although suicide rates differ with various social conditions , the explanation does not lie in external forces but in the attitudes and emotions of people . . . . Some people are subjected to greater social pressures than others . Finally , some countries provide more adequate guidance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may turn for help . <p> This brief bit of wisdom touches both the inner and the outer worlds of suicide with more empathy than any of Cavan 's predecessors had shown . <p> My turn came in 1973 , in an article that deliberately owed little to its forerunners . Its seven pages contained not a single statistical table . ( As I reread them in the company of the other articles on my dining table , I felt that in my urge to rescue the study of suicide from the numbing forces of statistics , I had gone too far and given short shrift to the field 's legitimate demographic aspects . ) The sections included : definition , complexities of definitions , major threads of study , psychological characteristics of suicide , attempted suicide , partial death and substitutes for suicide , suicide and religion , suicide and the law , myths about suicide , romantic suicide and the artist , statistics on suicide , suicide notes , and **35;476;TOOLONG . <p> One example will suffice to convey the article 's general tenor . Under " Main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the locus of blame for suicide . Saint Augustine and Saint Thomas Aquinas called suicide a grievous sin and located its source within the deficient person ; Rousseau emphasized the natural and innocent state of man and transferred the locus of blame from man to society ; Hume tried to sanitize suicide entirely by arguing that it was neither a crime nor a sin ; Durkheim focused on society 's inimical effects on the individual ; and Freud , eschewing the notions of sin and crime , gave suicide back to the individual but put the main locus of action in the unconscious mind . In other words , I attempted to present a variety of views on suicide instead of the single opinions that had dominated most of the earlier articles . My own expressed opinion is that each instance of suicide is a multidimensional event ( with biological , physiological , sociocultural , and existential components ) , but that the main trunk of the suicidal tree is the psychological drama that occurs in the individual 's mind : the need to escape from unbearable psychological pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death or cessation as the effective exit . Here is the heart of what -- now that I have read all the earlier articles -- I feel the EB had previously omitted : a recognition of suicide as a response to individual human suffering , a tragedy that befalls real people . <p> This article had a noteworthy personal consequence . For many years -- from 1950 , when I met him , until his death in 1988 at the age of ninety-five -- the psychological epicenter of my intellectual life was Henry A. Murray : physician , psychoanalyst , biologist , Melville scholar , director of the Harvard Psychological Clinic , and author of Explorations in Personality . ( There is a marvelous portrait of Henry Murray in the winter 1969 issue of THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR , by then-editor Hiram Haydn . ) Murray 's peerless writings influenced me more than any others , and I tried to spend as much time as possible in his presence . I was at Harvard for two extended stays -- as research associate in the early sixties and as visiting professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as often as I could arrange it . It was one of life 's high privileges for me to know him and to be made , by him , much more than I otherwise could have been . <p> In 1963 , in a paper about Melville titled " Dead to the World , " Murray had defined suicide as " no more than an urgently felt necessity to stop unbearable anguish , that is , to obtain relief by interrupting the stream of suffering . " He asked : " For what is suicide in most instances but an action to put an end to intolerable affect ? " You can see right away that my main ideas about the central role in suicide of psychological pain and negative emotions all flow from his fountain . In any event , in February 1973 , Harry wrote me : <p> Your encyclopaedia article is masterful . . . handsomely written to a marked extent in your own terminology . I could n't help thinking that this was possibly the timely moment to consider a shift in focus of spirit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paragraph changed my life . I knew Harry well enough to put aside his hyperbolic praise and to know that the real meat of that paragraph -- his covertly intended message -- lay in the serious criticism implied in the second sentence . He was telling me what I already knew inside : that I was temporarily burned out on the topic of suicide and ought to consider a shift of focus for a while . Harry 's note resonated with my own suspicion , which I had not fully admitted to myself until I read his words , that my EB article had been a mite too discursive and idiosyncratic . Accordingly , I shifted my clinical focus from patients who were suicidal to cancer patients who were coming to death unwillingly . I transformed myself from clinical suicidologist to clinical thanatologist , someone who deals with illness and mourning . When I returned to suicide a few years later , I believe I did so with a refreshed vision of self-destruction as well as a better understanding of the dynamics involved in the wrestling match with death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My piece was superseded in the Fifteenth Edition ( 1974-1984 ) by a wise and comprehensive five-page article by the late Erwin Stengel , professor of psychiatry at the University of Sheffield . Its most innovative section is headed " Suicide in the Future , " and Stengel 's predictions are not particularly rosy . He writes : <p> It is difficult to imagine man in the future without this potential , which has sometimes been proclaimed as one of the basic human freedoms . There are no prospects of an antisuicidal substance in the foreseeable future . There are certain aspects of present-day society that make a decline in the incidence of suicidal acts unlikely including the increased number of the aged . . . the young who are more openly aggressive . . . the continued increase in population . The outlook for suicide would be very black indeed if it were not for the strong urge to self-preservation inherent in the individual and in society . The emergence of nonprofessional movements toward self-help in the struggle against suicide can be seen as a manifestation of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thoroughly understood the value of statistics , also understood that suicide is a philosophical act . This is manifestly an encyclopedia article and not a novel . But Stengel 's empathetic sadness , deepened by his own background as a refugee from the Nazis , clearly shows through his prose and , in my view , makes it finer . Inexplicably , there are printings of the Fifteenth Edition in which Stengel 's indispensable essay on suicide does not appear . In these cases , I strongly advise the reader to seek another printing . <p> In the 1985-1997 printings of the Fifteenth Edition there is a half-page article in the Micropaedia ( Stengel 's piece is in the Macropaedia ) . Its concluding paragraph is especially topical : <p> No single approach can be expected to succeed in substantially reducing the incidence of suicide , but early detection and treatment of mental disorders are important deterrents . Since the 1950s special centres and organizations for the prevention of suicide have been created in many countries . . . . The telephone is commonly used as a means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and advisers who are available by day and night . There is evidence that this kind of service may help to avert suicidal acts . <p> The Encyclopaedia Britannica -- along with our society -- has obviously traveled several light-years since 1777 , when it excoriated suicide as cowardly , sinful , illegal , and shameful . The emphasis has shifted to the question , " How can we help ? " <p> My march through the centuries is complete , but a few ideas still swirl in the wake of my dual obsessions , suicide and the EB . The first idea is that there might be something to learn from similar Britannica surveys of other socially sensitive tag words . One might look , from 1768 ( or whenever the word first appears ) to the present date , at Addiction , Adultery , Childhood , Homosexuality , Insanity , and so forth . Scholars in different fields could suggest candidates for the word list . Put together , these would yield a lexicographic history of the past two centuries that might give some fresh insights into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns to the study of suicide . Why not take a look at the word in dictionaries of the past couple of hundred years ? Authoritative definitions are important . Indeed , dictionaries might provide us with a microcosm of what was happening in the encyclopedias of their times . <p> I believe I have good reason , beyond the fact that it is my own field , to think that our society 's views of suicide are important to all of us . I learned from a study I once did with the coroner of Marin County , California , that more than a quarter of all deaths -- all deaths , not just overt suicides -- are probably interlaced with threads of imprudence , disregard , excess , indifference , or ennui that bring an end to life sooner than is necessary . In other words , some people who have died what I call " subintentioned deaths " from heart attacks or automobile accidents may have a good deal in common with people who are termed " suicides . " In that sense alone , suicide is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of moving up the dates on our own tombstones . <p> The definition of any important term such as suicide gives it power-and also gives it honorific , neutral , or pejorative overtones . Denotation influences connotation . The connotative meanings of a word govern society 's responses to it . These community responses can cover a wide range : in the case of suicide , one extreme includes scorn , indifference , and punishment , and the other extreme includes empathy and therapy . And even within the realm of therapy , the very modalities are influenced by definition . Whether the therapeutic response is primarily pharmacological ( pills ) , surgical ( lobotomy ) , electrical ( shock ) , institutional ( hospitalization ) , or psychodynamic ( talk ) -- differences that are not trivial-may depend on the inner , unspoken definition of suicide and its connotative associations that one 's physician happens to hold . <p> Anthropologically speaking , dictionaries and encyclopedias are the two key books in any literate society . Each of us lives within ( or rebels against ) the reigning mores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . Much of our English-American Zeitgeist is reflected in the long history of the Encyclopaedia Britannica .

The self-reference I responded to in Chaucer and Shakespeare long ago acquired an academic moniker -- " reflexivity . " A related phenomenon , works referring to other works , was dubbed " intertextuality . " Together they are subsumed under the ubiquitous term " meta , " at one time a useful prefix for self-conscious endeavors , now an annoying , nearly all-purpose adjective . ( " The Matrix is very meta . " ) Practice has , if anything , outstripped theory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedians playing themselves , movies ( like Adaptation ) about the process of making a movie , buildings or paintings or poems or novels that refer to themselves as buildings or paintings or poems or novels : we have all , probably , had enough of them . <p> But I still respond to -- indeed , delight in -- reflexivity and intertextuality in one art form . That would be popular music . Flipping the radio dial , I get chills when I come on James Taylor 's " That 's Why I 'm Here " ( " Fortune and fame 's such a curious game / Perfect strangers can call you by name / Pay good money to hear ' Fire and Rain ' / Again and again and again " ) , or the Beatles ' " Glass Onion " ( " I told you ' bout Strawberry Fields , / You know the place where nothing is real " ) , Pink 's " Do n't Let Me Get Me " ( " Tired of being compared to / Damn Britney Spears / She 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even Eminem 's " White America " ( " Let 's do the math . / If I was black , I would 've sold half " ) . And I actually grin when a country station plays a recent hit by Alan Jackson that 's about , and is , a " Three Minute Positive Not Too Country Uptempo Love Song . " For years -- decades -- I have been collecting these songs , just as bird-watchers do with their sightings , separating my life list into categories and subcategories , and ranking all entries according to originality , profundity , and ultimate value . <p> I will share my system with you in a minute , as soon as I try to rebut the charge that self-reference in pop music does not escape the curses of preciousness , self-regard , clich , and portentousness it is subject to elsewhere . A clue to its avoidance strategy is the word itself : the music -- the melody , the singing , the instrumentation , the beat -- takes attention and a portion of the burden from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about popular music . The words to a song may lie leaden on the page in a CD booklet or an ill-conceived Collected Lyrics , but , through a strange alchemy , reverberate like poetry when they are accompanied by melody . In the same way , the music can remove the self-importance from a level of reflexivity that , drunk neat , would be deadly . <p> American popular song lyrics have always had a wide self-conscious streak . Possibly the most successful popular song of all time was Irving Berlin 's 1911 " Alexander 's Ragtime Band , " a song about music . Ira Gershwin 's first lyrics to be sung in public , in 1918 , were to " The Real American Folk Song Is a Rag " ; a later effort was " What Can You Say in a Love Song ( That Has n't Been Said Before ) ? " from the musical comedy " Life Begins at 8:40 , " beginning " Darling , here 's that song you inspired / In a style I acquired / Living with songs of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alley , the mythical locus of the popular songwriting industry , continually nudged one another in the ribs with reminders of what it was they were doing . The Alley was a closed cosmos , with songs commenting on predecessors and begetting successors : first , " Meet Me Tonight in Dreamland , " then " When I Met You Tonight in Dreamland " and " Dreamland Brings Memories of You . " <p> The great American songwriters , all of whom either started on Tin Pan Alley or were begotten by it , liked to tip their hats to one another . In " They Ca n't Take That Away from Me , " Gershwin name-checks one of Irving Berlin 's classics : " The song is ended , but as the songwriter wrote / ' The Melody Lingers On . ' " Berlin , who normally looked straight ahead in his lyrics , permitted himself , " Tuneful , tasteful , soulful , smart . / Music : Rodgers . Lyrics : Hart . " In " You 're the Top , " Cole Porter paired " Waldorf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gifted humans like Vincent Youmans , " surely one of the all-time great rhymes . It was Porter who took this sort of thing beyond intramural bantering to high wit . He wrote the immortal couplet " But how strange / The change from major to minor , " which is sung just as the key of the song ( " Every Time We Say Goodbye " ) changes from major to minor . " It 's De-Lovely , " from the musical " Anything Goes , " begins , " I feel a sudden urge to sing / The kind of ditty that invokes the spring . / So control your desire to curse / While I crucify the verse . / This verse I 've started seems to me / The ' Tin-Pan-tithesis ' of melody . / So to spare you all the pain , / I 'll skip the darn thing and sing the refrain . " Tin-Pan-tithesis : the formulation deserves a moment of silence . <p> Hoagy Carmichael 's " Stardust , " which some authorities consider the greatest American song , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " haunts my reverie ... Now my consolation / Is in the stardust of a song . " Is the song " Stardust " ? It 's a mystery , but a sweet one . <p> Tin Pan Alley was zoned out of existence a long time ago . But today 's generically striated pop universe -- country , hip-hop , rock , and so forth , each with its own further gradations -- is just as self-referential . In fact , it 's more so , and in order to assess the field adequately I 'll need to break it into two groups , the reflexive and the intertextual , each with a meta offshoot . <p> The first category consists of songs that refer to or are about themselves , in the manner of " Ode to a Nightingale " and " It 's De-Lovely . " And so : Elton John 's " Your Song " ; James Taylor 's " Hey Mister , That 's Me Up On the Jukebox " ( " I 'm the one who 's singing this sad song " ) ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Song By Heart " ; George Harrison 's " This Song " ( the two-word phrase occurs in most of these entries ) ; Simon and Garfunkel 's " Song for the Asking " ; Carly Simon 's " You 're So Vain " ( " You probably think this song is about you " ) ; The Doors ' " Hello , I Love You " ( " When she moves , my brain sings out this song " ) ; Jim Croce 's " I 'll Have to Say I Love You in a Song " ; Public Enemy 's " Bring the Noise " ( " Radio stations I question their blackness / They call themselves black , / But we 'll see if they play this " ) ; Three Dog Night 's " Old-Fashioned Love Song " ; Spandau Ballet 's " True " ( " Why do I find it hard to write the next line ? " ) ; Steely Dan 's " Deacon Blues " ( " I cried when I wrote this song / Sue me if I play too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broke My Promise " ( " That I would n't write another song about you . / I guess I lied " ) ; the Beatles ' " Only a Northern Song " ( " If you 're listening to this song / You may think the chords are going wrong " ) and " Michelle " ( " These are words that go together well " ) . <p> One thing should be immediately apparent from the list : reflexiveness can be associated with both good and bad songs . You do n't have to be familiar with every title to grasp that , merely with the two biggest chartbusters , by Elton John and Three Dog Night . " Old-Fashioned Love Song " is a bland and genial ditty , saved -- barely -- from complete negligibility by its self-reference . Bernie Taupin 's lyrics to " Your Song , " swept along by John 's potent melody , are , like many lyric poems , convincingly about the challenges of doing justice in words to the loved one 's qualities . Toward the end , they double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word is like a bell " fashion , the singer admitting , haltingly , " You see I 've forgotten if they 're green or they 're blue . / Anyway the thing is , what I really mean , / Yours are the sweetest eyes I 've ever seen . " <p> There 's nothing special or mysterious about what makes good self-conscious songs good -- just adequate artistry , originality , wit , and feeling . The last is especially important , but the other qualities can go a long way as well . The rapper Nas does some dazzlingly reflexive sleight of hand , in the braggadocious mode hip-hop has claimed for its own , when he raps , " They shootin ! / Aw , made you look . / You a slave to a page in my rhyme book . " <p> In this subgenre , the song about itself , one trope has inspired some particularly ingenious lyric writing : imagining the effect the song will have on listeners when it comes out of the radio or , especially in country music , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reminiscent of the Aeolian Harp or Lyre , a common image in Romantic poetry : the winds of the world would blow through it and make haunting melodies . ) The country singer David Allan Coe has a number called " I 'm Going to Hurt Her on the Radio , " and Buck Owens 's 1979 song " Play ' Together Again ' Again " asks a bystander to put in a quarter and punch the numbers of an earlier Owens hit . Bruce Springsteen 's moving " Bobby Jean , " addressed to a friend or lover who 's unexpectedly taken a powder , conjectures : " Maybe you 'll be out there on that road / Somewhere in some bus or train / Traveling along in some motel room / There 'll be a radio playing and you 'll hear me sing this song . / Well , if you do , you 'll know I 'm thinking of you . " <p> Loudon Wainwright III 's mordant " Pretty Good Day " is a catalogue of small victories . The singer wakes up and finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets without hearing any sirens or getting shot or even seeing any snipers , and when he gets home , he says , " Nobody was frightened , wounded , hungry , or cold . " The final stanza is unanticipatedly cathartic : " I slept through the night , got through to the dawn / I flipped the switch and the light went on . / I wrote down my dream , I wrote this song . " Those last four words turn the closing refrain -- " It 's a pretty good day so far " -- from ironic self-protection to a welcome truth . <p> None of the lyrical maneuvers or tropes I 've described above should be unfamiliar to past or present English majors , who would do well to equip their computers with a global key that produces the phrase , " Just as in the poem ... " Indeed , it is accepted wisdom that reflexivity is an , if not the , obsession of modern poetry . You find it explicitly in , for example , Archibald MacLeish 's " Ars Poetica " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) , and implicitly pretty much wherever you look -- in Pound , Eliot , Stevens . But there 's an advanced class of pop-music reflexivity that is little seen in these poets , although , come to think of it , it 's everywhere in Whitman , who even gave it a name : " Song of Myself . " In popular music , this is a post-Beatles phenomenon . In the pre-rock era , a popular singer -- think Frank Sinatra -- was manifestly an actor , convincingly giving voice to the playwright 's ( songwriter 's ) words and music . One of the few figures who combined singing and songwriting ( as well as a capacious ego ) was George M. Cohan , and his work was full of explicitly autobiographical representations , most famously in " The Yankee Doodle Boy . " <p> Now singers and bands are expected to have composed their own material , and the Cohan stance is standard . Most blatantly , there is the song about the singer or singers : sometimes merely saying his , her , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrating . For some reason , the one that always comes to mind is the Monkees ' theme song , the one that starts , " Hey , hey , we 're the Monkees . " ( Surely Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five were paying homage to those boys in " The Message " when they rapped , " Hey , we 're Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five . " A later rap ensemble kicked it up a notch and were n't paying homage to anybody in a song piquantly titled , " Wu-Tang Clan Ai n't Nuthing to **** Wit " ) . But there are many others . The late-seventies band Devo memorably chanted , " Are we not men ? / We are Devo ! " The Mamas and the Papas ' " Creeque Alley " is a musical memoir in the form of a shaggy-dog story : " John and Mitchy were getting kind of itchy / Just to leave the folk music behind / Zol and Denny workin ' for a penny / Tryin ' to get a fish on the line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang " The Ballad of John and Yoko , " just as Mott the Hoople sang " The Ballad of Mott the Hoople . " Grand Funk Railroad protested too much in " We 're an American Band , " and Jennifer Lopez recently used autobiography as spin control when she tried to convince her longtime fans that despite all the magazine covers and bling-bling , she was still " Jenny from the Block . " John Eddie has a painfully funny recent song about a special circle of hell for the singer-songwriter : the bar where a drunk loudly asks , " Who the Hell is John Eddie ? " ( The title of the song is the heckler 's command -- " Play Some Skynyrd . " ) The blustery " I Write the Songs " indulged in enough egotism to taint both the author ( Bruce Johnston of the Beach Boys ) and the bellower of the highest-charting version ( Barry Manilow ) . Moving from the ridiculous to the sublime : It is n't surprising that thoughtful singer-songwriters like Neil Young , Joni Mitchell , Merle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about music 's significance to them , in , respectively , " From Hank to Hendrix , " " For Free , " " After I Sing My Songs , " and " Old . " <p> A subtler , off-center kind of introspection can be found in the alter-ego song or group of songs , presented in the voice of a performer who has something but not everything in common with the actual one : the Beatles ' " Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , " Dire Straits ' " Sultans of Swing , " Eminem 's Slim Shady , David Bowie 's Ziggy Stardust , Billy Joel 's " Piano Man . " Glen Campbell has bookended his career with two such songs ( neither of which he wrote ) : the 1975 " Rhinestone Cowboy , " in which an unknown dreams of " getting cards and letters from people I do n't even know , " and the more recent " Mansion in Bronson , " in which the record company tells an aging country star , " You 're too out of shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small masterpiece in the subgenre is Randy Newman 's " Lonely at the Top , " whose singer , evidently a show-biz icon , boasts , " I 've been around the world / Had my pick of any girl . " Newman wrote this when he was a struggling songwriter and performer with no albums to his credit . <p> I actually prefer autobiographical moments to autobiographical songs . In " You Got ta Serve Somebody , " Dylan ( n Robert Zimmerman ) , normally unforthcoming to the point of invisibility , shockingly proclaims , " You may call me Bobby , you may call me Zimmy . " In " Tenth Avenue Freezeout , " Springsteen recalls " When they made that change uptown and the Big Man joined the band . " The Big Man : saxophonist and crowd favorite Clarence Clemons ; in concert , the line always gets a roar . James Taylor 's " Fire and Rain " talks about " Sweet dreams and flying machines . " Flying Machine : Taylor 's first band . A great moment in the Supremes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singer Diana Ross interrupts her romantic lament to wonder , " How can Mary tell me what to do / When she lost her love so true ? / And Flo , she do n't know / Cause the boy she loves is a Romeo . " Mary and Flo : fellow Supremes Mary Wilson and Florence Birdsong . One puzzling but cool thing about the aside is that it ( like the rest of the song ) was n't written by Ross but by Motown staff composers Holland-Dozier-Holland . In " Showbiz Kids , " Steely Dan throws in an unexpected self-reference in the manner of a Hitchcock cameo or a postage-stamp portrait-of-the-artist in a vast landscape : " They got the Steely Dan T-shirts . " <p> When it comes to singing about yourself , the hands-down champions are two musical forms that are rarely , if ever , associated with each other : country and hip-hop . They show up disproportionately in all these categories , in fact ; one reason is that they still prize the Tin Pan Alley values of word-play and wit . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oral tradition , rap is partial to boasts about the rapper 's prowess in rhyming , loving , fighting , etc . Thus Run-DMC raps , " I 'm the king of rock , there ai n't none higher / Sucker MCs should call me sire . " In another number , Run-DMC gives its deejay , Jam Master Jay ( since deceased ) , his props : " J-A-Y are the letters of his name / Cuttin ' and scratchin ' are the aspects of his game , / So check out the Master as he cuts these jams / And look at us with the mikes in our hands . " <p> Early country performers tended to sing their hymns of love , memory , and heartbreak through generic personae , although Jimmie Rodgers had a song about himself called " Jimmie the Kid " and Ernest Tubb one called " When I First Began to Sing , " which cited Rodgers as an influence . The greatest country singer was Hank Williams . The power of his lyrics lay in their seemingly complete emotional sincerity ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1953 , he was on the charts with a song called " I 'll Never Get Out of This World Alive . " But he made few , if any , direct references to himself -- ironic , considering how obsessively he has been invoked by others . Modern country autobiography began in 1971 , when Johnny Cash recorded " The Man in Black , " which explained his wardrobe ( " I wear it for the thousands who have died , / Believin ' that the Lord was on their side , " among other reasons ) , and Loretta Lynn recorded " Coal Miner 's Daughter , " which told the story of Loretta Lynn 's life . Both songs gave their creators indelible nicknames -- and nicknames are very , very big in country . <p> The floodgates opened with the " outlaw country " movement a couple of years later , which took as its text Kitty Wells 's old number " The Life They Live in Songs . " Willie " Red-Headed Stranger " Nelson and Waylon " Hoss " Jennings , in particular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nelson spun picaresque yarns like " On the Road Again , " " Me and Paul , " and " Devil in a Sleeping Bag " and angrily told greedy record-company executives to " Write Your Own Songs " ; Jennings asked rhetorically , " Do n't You Think This Outlaw Bit 's Done Got Out of Hand ? " and " Are You Sure Hank Done It This Way ? " <p> The laureate of country memoir is Hank Williams Jr. , also known as Bocephus , who was just three years old when his father died . As a child , he went on the road singing Hank Williams songs , in an uncanny imitation of Hank Williams 's voice . The experience was unenviable , but it provided young Bocephus with a great theme . In 1966 , when Hank Jr . was seventeen , he wrote and recorded " Standing in the Shadows " : " I know I 'm not great , and some say I imitate .... It 's hard when you 're standing in the shadows of a very famous man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the late 1970s and early ' 80s issued a series of compelling songs -- including " The Conversation , " " Living Proof , " and " Whisky Bent and Hellbound " -- about trying to live up to his father 's musical standards and at the time escape the legacy of a self-destructive life and early death . His masterpiece , I would say , is " Family Tradition , " where the refrain alternates between a lament and a sort of rueful and rollicking celebration : " Lord , I have loved some ladies and I have loved Jim Beam / And they both tried to kill me in 1973. / When that doctor asked me , / ' Son how did you get in this condition ? ' / I said , ' Hey sawbones , I 'm just carrying on / An ole family tradition . ' " <p> The autobiographical expectation in country has become sufficiently entrenched as to spawn ghostwriters . That is , everyone in Nashville knows that George " Possum " Jones does n't write his own songs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he is expected to sing about himself . Therefore , other writers regularly supply him with numbers that allow him to poke fun at his own image , like " I Do n't Need Your Rocking Chair " and " ( They Call Me ) No-Show Jones . " I have no problem with that , but the self-mythologizing of minor figures , like David Allen Coe in " Waylon , Willie , and Me , " can get wearing . <p> " Waylon , Willie , and Me " : The song is also an example of the second broad category , musical intertextuality , where the references are to other compositions and performers . Unavoidable examples are Don McLean 's " American Pie " and Rick Nelson 's " Garden Party , " rather self-satisfied allegories that all but demand crib sheets to parse the references . ( In " American Pie , " " the King " is Elvis and " the Jester " is Dylan -- but who 's " the Queen " ? ) By contrast , a single well-placed musical allusion can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : see Mary Chapin Carpenter 's " there ai n't no cure for my blues today / Except when the paper says Beausoleil is coming to town " ; Springsteen 's " Roy Orbison sang for the lonely " ; Stephen Bishop 's " put on Sinatra and start to cry " ; Nirvana 's " Give me a Leonard Cohen afterworld / So I can sigh eternally " ; Steely Dan 's " Hey Nineteen " ( " that 's ' Retha Franklin / She do n't remember the Queen of Soul " ) ; Calexico 's song " Not Even Stevie Nicks " ; the Police 's line " An Otis Redding record , it 's all I own , " and Davis Daniel 's " She went to William and Mary , / I went to Haggard and Jones . " <p> Earlier , I mentioned some early Tin Pan Alley " response " songs , and that continuing tradition definitely supplies an intertextual frisson . In 1954 , an R &; B singer named Hank Ballard put out a suggestive record , full of double entendres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was so successful that it crossed over to the pop charts , and Ballard and his band , the Midnighters , followed it up with " Annie Had a Baby ( Ca n't Work No More ) , " " Annie 's Aunt Fannie , " and " Henry 's Got Flat Feet ( Ca n't Dance No More ) . " Others got into the act as well , most notably Etta James , in " Roll with Me , Henry . " ( A white singer , Georgia Gibbs , released a sanitized version , " Dance with Me , Henry . " ) That kind of call-and-response is a sign of vitality and attentiveness in the art form . <p> It can be even more invigorating when song number two begs to differ with song number one . Hank Thompson 's reflexive 1951 " The Wild Side of Life " starts with the lament that since the singer 's wife has abandoned him , he must give her his message " in the words of this song . " And the message is , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the places where the wine and liquor flows . " Kitty Wells 's response came swiftly , and constituted a rousing pre-feminism feminist statement : " As I sit here tonight , the jukebox playing / That old song about the wild , wild side of life . / As I listen to the words you are saying , / It brings memories when I was a trusting wife . / It was n't God who made honky-tonk angels / As you say in the words of your song . " UTFO 's early rap song " Roxanne , Roxanne " inspired some twenty-five responses , including two by singers who adopted the name of the girl in the song and told her side of the story : Roxanne Shante and the Real Roxanne . Merle Haggard 's " Okie from Muskogee " spawned Big Brother and the Holding Company 's " I 'll Fix Your Flat Tire , Merle " and " Up Against the Wall , Redneck Mother , " written by Ray Wylie Hubbard and performed by Jerry Jeff Walker . And who can forget Lynyrd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope Neil Young will remember / Southern man do n't need him around anyhow " ? <p> As this suggests , response songs can move beyond disagreement to assault and battery . In a sour mood , John Lennon asked Paul McCartney , " How Do You Sleep ? " ( " The freaks was right when they said you was dead . " ) Richard Thompson 's " I Agree with Pat Metheny " refers to Metheny 's outburst against saxophonist Kenny G 's digitized " duet " with Louis Armstrong : " A meeting of the minds , how nice / Like Einstein and Sporty Spice . " Joan Baez got Dylan -- " the unwashed phenomenon , the original vagabond " -- inmost famously in " Diamonds and Rust , " but stuck the knife in a little deeper in " Oh Brother , " which begins " You 've got eyes like Jesus / But you speak with a viper 's tongue . " They Might Be Giants ' catty " Rhythm Section Want Ad " asks " Do you sing like Olive Oyl on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " John Hiatt 's " Memphis in the Morning , " a rare anti-country-music song , correctly observes , " I do n't think Ronnie Milsap 's ever going to record this song . " <p> The genre that thrives on insults -- also known as " beefs " -- is , of course , rap , where it 's understood that the more derisively a performer can put down a competitor , the more decisively he can elevate himself . The still-unsolved murders of the feuding Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G . several years ago put a bit of a damper on all-out beefing , but it has returned in a stylized and presumably stage-managed form , reminiscent of show-business rows like the one between Jack Benny and Fred Allen . So , Nelly on KRS-One : " You the first old man should get a rapper 's pension / No hits since the cordless mic invention . " Nas 's " Ether " asked Jay-Z , " How much of Biggie 's rhymes is gon na come out your fat lips ? " ; Jay-Z responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair with the mother of Nas 's daughter . Eazy-E took on a major hip-hop figure with " All of a sudden Dr. Dre is a g-thing / But on his old album covers , he was a she-thing . " ( " G " is short for gangsta . ) Not exactly Oscar Wilde , but it works for me . <p> Country music , by contrast , favors an intertextuality of admiration , most visibly in the tribute song . To be sure , country has no monopoly on this sometimes moving , sometimes schmaltzy , sometimes crass genre . Ronnie McDowell recorded " The King Is Gone " the day after Elvis Presley 's death , and it 's been followed by 202 more Elvis tributes , according to New York deejay Peter Bochan , who lists them on his Web site ( http : **32;1014;TOOLONG ) . If there 's a " Rock and Roll Heaven , " the Righteous Brothers memorably noted , " you know they 've got a hell of a band . " George Harrison sang about John Lennon in " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorialized George in " Never Without You . " The Commodores ' " Night Shift " honors the estimable lineup of fallen soul singers , and Tupac Shakur has been mourned in Master P 's " Is There a Heaven 4 a Gangsta ? , " Richie Rich 's " Do G 's Go to Heaven ? , " and Naughty By Nature 's " Mourn Till I Join Ya , " which avers , " Nigga I miss ya this thug gon na miss ya till I 'm witcha . " <p> But this is as nothing compared with country tribute songs . The tradition started in 1933 , with the death of the Singing Brakeman , Jimmie Rodgers , at the age of thirty-five . Just days later , " When Jimmie Rodgers Said Goodbye " was issued , followed by " The Train Carrying Jimmie Rodgers Home , " " The Life of Jimmie Rodgers , " " The Passing of Jimmie Rodgers , " and many others . Hank Williams 's death twenty years later , at the age of twenty-nine , was followed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metress , sixteen songs honoring Williams were released in 1953 alone , and there has been no sign of a letup . A German devotee of American country music lists ninety-six Williams tribute songs on his Web site ( http : //www.haukestruebing.com ) , including " Hank Williams Meets Jimmie Rodgers , " " Hank Williams Sings the Blues No More , " " Please Do n't Let the Name ' Hank ' Die , " " Everybody Wants to Be Hank Williams , " Jerry Jeff Walker 's " I Feel Like Hank Williams Tonight , " and Johnny Cash 's " The Night Hank Williams Came to Town . " <p> Country songwriters love tribute songs so much that they even write them to singers who are still alive , as in David Allan Coe 's " Hank Williams Jr , " ; Toby Keith 's " I 'll Never Smoke Weed with Willie Again " ; Tim McGraw 's " Give It to Me Strait " ; Chris Wall 's " An Outlaw 's Blues , " about Waylon Jennings ; Becky Hollis 's " Jones on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Why I Sing This Way " ( the reason , he explains , is " Mama used to whip me with a George Jones album " ) . Before his death in September 2003 , Johnny Cash was the subject of " ( In the Mood for ) Johnny Cash , " " Hooked on Johnny Cash , " " Walking Talking Johnny Cash Blues , " Billy Joe Shaver 's " That 's Why the Man in Black Sings the Blues , " and his own daughter Roseanne 's lovely " My Old Man . " <p> If you sing a song of a certain kind , if your parents sang that song , and if you expect that your children will sing it as well , then you 're not likely to attempt to characterize , explain , or defend it in a song . But sometimes a musical genre is more contentious . Listeners and performers think about and define themselves by it . That the blues is a highly self-conscious genre can be grasped merely from the fact that roughly half of blues songs contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock and roll were lyrically proclaimed seemingly from the moment of its birth , the constant invocation of " rock " and " rock and roll " being only partly explained by the terms ' sexual innuendo . Bill Haley and the Comets asked us to " Rock Around the Clock " ; Chuck Berry wrote a song ( covered by the Beatles ) called , simply , " Rock and Roll Music " and in another commanded , " Hail , hail rock and roll " ; Danny and the Juniors proclaimed " Rock and Roll Is Here to Stay . " Meanwhile , rearguard singers vocally demurred , as Nat King Cole in " Mr. Cole Wo n't Rock and Roll , " which regretfully observed , " When Tin Pan Alley serenades a beauty / Do they sing of Rose Marie or Sweet Lorraine ? / No , they dedicate a hymn to Tutti Frutti , / Who 's as tender as a dame from Mickey Spillane . " The Byrds ' " So You Want To Be a Rock and Roll Star " was a biographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1974 " It 's Only Rock and Roll ( But I Like It ) " was appropriate , since the battle had long been won , although heavy-metal anthems of the late ' 70s and early ' 80s , such as AC/DC 's " Let There Be Rock , " protested excessively in invoking rock ( never rock and roll ) as a near-holy pursuit . And , needless to say , there will never be an end to boring songs about life on the road . <p> When it comes to meta-music , yet again , country is king . There is a curious history here . As Richard A. Peterson explains in his 1997 book Creating Country Music , the word country itself was an invention of the early 1950s .

" <p> There are three broad historical categories . The first were self-congratulatory : songs about how wonderful Jimmie , Hank , and Lefty were ; how the singer is following in their path ; how there 's nothing like a country song to express joy or heartbreak . The second , more contentious and dating from the 1970s , recognized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " country music .

One of Hank Jr . ' s several entries in this category , " Why Do n't You Leave Them Boys Alone ? " ( cowritten with Tanya Tucker ) , was noteworthy because he was joined on it not only by Waylon Jennings but also by one of the old guard , Ernest Tubb . <p> The third , still-current type is a lament , summed up in the lyrics of the Dixie Chicks ' recent hit " Long Time Gone " : " the music ai n't got no soul / Now they sound tired but they do n't sound Haggard / They 've got money but they do n't have Cash . / They got Junior but they do n't have Hank .

" The villains of these pieces are n't rock bands but the likes of Billy Ray Cyrus , Garth Brooks , Faith Hill , and Shania Twain : the cowboy-hatted , midriff-baring Barbie and Ken dolls whose bland and innocuous sounds push real country artists off the so-called country stations . Performers like Tritt , Alan Jackson , Vince Gill , and Marty Stuart include at least one such critique on every CD they release . Stuart is the most self-consciously militant of this group . His most recent recording is called Country Music , which is a little like Jonathan Franzen putting out a novel called Contemporary Fiction . <p> Have I justified my obsession ? If not , it 's probably too late to defend it . But I will say that as fatuous , lame , inauthentic , and cheesy as popular music often is , it manages to retain a gravity not often found in other arts , low or high .

Music 's logic is at its base emotional and thus not as easily assailed . More elevated works -- say , an off-off-Broadway play in which the actors start commenting on the previous scene , or a contemporary painting that , in its use of color or texture , is " about " painting -- have a contrary problem : they are trees falling in , if not a forest , then a very sparsely populated region . In pop music , good or bad , there is usually the sense that something is at stake . As a result , it demands our attention . Bob Dylan is no Shakespeare , but , like Shakespeare , he appears to be putting a great deal on the line . In the song " Sara , " Dylan sings of " staying up for days in the Chelsea Hotel , / Writing ' Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands ' for you . " That puts me , for one , in mind of Prospero .

Is it any wonder that the cost of higher education is out of control and that the mission of most universities appears to be garbled and inconsistent ? American universities have tried unsuccessfully to be all things to all people . In so doing they find themselves in too many unrelated and disconnected businesses . They have become academic behemoths . <p> During higher education 's " roaring eighties " we said no to almost no one . By the nineties , we had become virtually unmanageable . This is a far cry from the fifties and sixties when universities were viewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberals as agents of social change , and by taxpayers as avenues of social mobility . <p> Overspecialization and functional isolation are two reasons college costs consistently outpace inflation . Each department or professional school is an island unto itself , cooperating with no one . Promotions and faculty salaries are closely linked to publications within one 's narrowly defined discipline . Departments compete for students and resources . Research and writing are rewarded ; teaching is not . <p> It is not uncommon for a university 's business school , divinity school , law school , engineering school , and medical school each to have its own separate library . The Fuqua School of Business at Duke University has its own dining hall , computer center , audiovisual center , placement service , alumni office , and luxury hotel for executive education programs . <p> The cost of high-tech research equipment soared in the 1970s and 1980s -- particularly in engineering , physical science , and medicine . The cost of research in such fields as particle physics and molecular biology is prohibitively expensive . But is all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergraduates with a well-rounded liberal arts education ? We think not . <p> Undergraduate education and state-of-the-art research are two quite different businesses . Does it make sense to try to combine them under one umbrella called a university ? Middlebury College is an excellent undergraduate educational institution . MIT , Caltech , and the Stanford Research Institute are world-class research institutes . Should not Amherst , Middlebury , Mount Holyoke , Vassar , and Williams specialize in undergraduate teaching , and MIT , Caltech , and Carnegie Mellon in basic and applied research ? The necessary skills for successful research grantsmanship are not the same skills required to be a good undergraduate teacher . Why do so many academics pretend otherwise ? <p> The prevailing attitude among most state universities , caught in the competition for tax dollars since World War II , has been " bigger makes better . " Now we find ourselves burdened with huge institutions . There is a serious need for downsizing . There are also , we believe , far too many universities in the United States . Some are so tiny that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Others are so large that they are fundamentally unmanageable . The state of North Carolina , for example -- a relatively poor state with a population of 6.8 million -- has no fewer than fifteen state universities plus another seven private universities . The state also has four medical schools -- two public and two private . On the other hand , tiny Vermont sensibly has only one state university . <p> The proliferation of universities with the inherent duplication of programs and infrastructure has contributed significantly to the skyrocketing cost of higher education . America needs not more universities but more small undergraduate colleges . But we have acted as if sheer size makes no difference when it comes to achieving the mission of higher education . <p> Countering the trend toward giantism in universities is well-managed Oklahoma City University with only 4,660 students , of which 2,400 are undergraduates . Although OCU 's strong international programs attract students from 71 different countries , 75 percent of OCU 's undergraduates -- including many American Indians -- are from Oklahoma . OCU produces a high-quality product , at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university campuses . The administrators of OCU seem to know what business they are in and have created an environment with a strong sense of community between faculty and students . <p> Just as there are too many small universities whose quest for university status has distracted them from the task of undergraduate education , there are also too many universities that have become inefficient , dehumanized , bureaucratic agglomerations of unrelated businesses . Undergraduate , professional , graduate , and adult education ; housing ; food service ; dental and health care services ; book publishing ; agricultural extension services ; management consulting ; public service ; and semiprofessional athletics are among the plethora of unrelated businesses in which large universities find themselves . <p> With 52,183 students , 38,958 of whom are undergraduates , the Columbus campus of Ohio State University , the largest university in the United States , more closely resembles a small city than an academic community . It is not alone : Mega-Universities PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Throughout the 1960s , many universities grew haphazardly , without any well-defined sense of direction . New programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and new sources of government funding . Not unlike the programs of the federal government , obsolete academic programs are seldom allowed to die . Instead , they continue indefinitely , long after their original rationale has faded . Restructuring Higher Education <p> We believe that what is called for in higher education is nothing less than a complete restructuring of universities , including the way they are organized , the way undergraduates are taught , and the substance of the curriculum . The ultimate aim of restructuring is to improve the quality of undergraduate education , increase its value , and reduce its costs -- to create a community of scholars and teachers that will enhance students ' critical thinking skills and their search for meaning . <p> While we know that smallness alone is no guarantee of a school 's educational effectiveness , we do believe that a large size is a mostly negative factor in achieving the goals of higher education . Universities are not immune to the law of decreasing returns with regard to increased size . We would estimate the optimum-size undergraduate learning environment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand students subdivided into English-style residential colleges of around three hundred students each . Large state universities , with their dehumanizing high-rise dormitories , legions of graduate teaching assistants , and tens of thousands of undergraduates are antithetical to the pursuit of knowledge , meaning , and community . There are those who respond , " But do n't many students at larger schools do quite well on standardized tests like the GRE or the LSAT ? " Such arguments fail to move us . The quantification and standardization of education , represented in such tests , is precisely what we are arguing against . Even relatively small universities like Duke , with 6,130 undergraduates , and the University of Vermont , with 7,925 , are difficult to control . Viable undergraduate learning communities at the mega-universities described previously are an almost impossible dream . <p> What we are proposing is downsizing colleges and universities to a more reasonable scale and eventually decoupling undergraduate education from the largest of them . Growth at universities with more than five thousand undergraduates should be brought to a halt . Proposals for new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , large universities should either completely spin off their undergraduate programs or significantly decentralize them in a manner consistent with the residential college mode . Too many of our universities resemble General Motors of the fifties . While American business has radically transformed the World War II-induced behemoths churning out haphazardly built products , American higher education is still saddled with huge institutional relics that produce assembly-line graduates . American higher education must show some of the same creativity and courage that we have seen recently in much of American business . Downsizing is the order of the day . <p> The three best-known American examples of the residential college systems are Harvard , Princeton , and Yale . Yale 's twelve residential colleges are self-sufficient communities within Yale College , each with its own dining hall , library , courtyard , seminar rooms , practice rooms , and numerous other facilities , from darkrooms to printing presses , from game rooms to saunas . At the end of their first year , Harvard students are assigned to a house in which they will live for the remainder of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior tutor or dean , a tutorial staff , a library , and dining facilities . All houses are coeducational , and much of the social , athletic , extracurricular , and academic life at Harvard centers on the house . At Princeton all freshmen and sophomores live and dine in one of five residential colleges . A small number of juniors and seniors live and eat in the residential colleges , but most live in the upperclass dorms , and more than half dine in Princeton 's well-known independent eating clubs . <p> We are not suggesting that the residential college system , as practiced by the aforementioned universities , is a panacea . We know that the residential college experiments at the University of Virginia and at Princeton have had their critics . Yet we do defend the notion that size is an important issue . Even with the residential college system , size mitigates against the benefits of residential colleges when , as is the case at Harvard , there are 6,672 undergraduates dominated by 11,601 graduate students and professional students . <p> In 1994 , tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to education and its high tuition , sent shock waves through the American higher education establishment when it announced its plans to implement one of the most radical college restructuring schemes ever conceived . The reconfiguration called for faculty and staff reductions , the abolition of tenure , the elimination of traditional academic departments , a 10 percent cut in tuition and fees , the adoption of an alternative contractual system for faculty , and the establishment of a revolving venture-capital fund to support innovative new faculty ideas . <p> All of this was in response to declining enrollments , a $1 million deficit , serious erosion of academic standards , poor faculty morale , and organizational chaos . Bennington was not only out of control , it was in a death spiral . But to its credit , Bennington was small enough and flexible enough to reinvent itself . Most large colleges and universities are not . <p> Over the long term , during the next decade , we are proposing that large universities withdraw from the undergraduate teaching business . The university of the future would consist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research institutions , adult education , and professional outreach services . State universities would provide support services to a network of colleges not located on the central university campus , including administrative and financial services , library services , and central computing facilities , as well as specialized courses for advanced undergraduates . Seniors in satellite colleges affiliated with the university might be allowed to take a limited number of graduate courses at the university . <p> Moreover , we encourage those who charge that these proposals would be extravagantly expensive to be honest about the extravagance , the waste , and the redundancy present in the large educational institutions . There are functions of the university , particularly those that thrive on communication , interaction , and cooperation , where costs increase and efficiency declines as the bureaucracy grows . Downsizing is not a call to withdraw from the commitment to educate the largest possible number of qualified students , but rather an attempt to give all of our students the best possible education by the most efficient means . <p> To finance the shift toward decentralized liberal arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and graduate programs . For many states -- not including California , New York , and Texas -- there is little need for multiple , state-supported medical schools , law schools , and engineering schools . Many underfinanced , undersubscribed universities should be downsized back to colleges . Having experienced a couple of decades during which numerous colleges and two-year institutions frantically moved toward pinning the name " university " upon themselves , we must now help these schools recover the dignity , the focus , and the efficiency that comes from reclaiming their identity as colleges dedicated to undergraduate education . <p> Not every state needs a dental school , a veterinary school , or state-of-the-art research institutions in nuclear physics and microbiology . The cold war is over and we do not need nearly so many nuclear physicists , mathematicians , chemists , and defense-related engineers . As taxpayers demand cutbacks in the defense budget , research universities are going to discover painfully how much of their intellectual activity has been dictated by the Pentagon . A preoccupation with short-run profitability and stock prices has prompted American companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only is there less demand for Ph.D.s in basic science and engineering , but there is also less private and government funding available to support expensive high-tech research in these fields . Be well assured that if our faculties and administrators do not take this opportunity , they shall then be led through the humiliating process of having legislators and mere market pressures hack their schools to pieces , bit by bit . <p> Graduate education has always cost more than undergraduate education because of small class sizes and laboratory equipment requirements . Universities should become much more selective in choosing departments and fields in which to offer Ph.D . degrees . The manner in which some graduate departments continue to produce Ph.D.s in fields already oversupplied borders on the immoral . Those who would defend the mega-universities on the basis of their altruistic desire to provide the largest possible number of students with access to higher education ought honestly to examine how much potential undergraduate funding is siphoned off at these institutions by expensive , glamorous , but relatively unproductive graduate and professional programs . For too long undergraduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the university for graduate and professional work . We want to reverse that process , inviting universities to see themselves as existing for and supportive of the task of undergraduate education . <p> Since professors in newly emerging liberal arts colleges will not be under the university publish-or-perish mandate , they can be expected to teach more -- perhaps as many as four or five courses per semester . <p> As universities begin downsizing and cutting back on their undergraduate programs , former undergraduate dormitories can either be transformed to graduate and professional dormitories or converted to apartment buildings or much-needed housing for the elderly . We see much educational value in colleges attempting to foster more interaction between the generations . <p> With modern telecommunications networks , universities may offer their satellite colleges televised courses on topics too specialized to be included in the curricula of most small colleges , such as Chinese , Japanese , advanced physics , and molecular biology . Universities might be seen as resource centers that offer support for strong undergraduate colleges , the strong undergraduate colleges being the basic units of American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than as their norm to emulate . <p> Why should universities continue to support big-time football and basketball programs ? University stadiums and basketball field houses could be sold or rented to nearby professional teams . In downsizing , intercollegiate athletics would return to the scale on which it existed before World War II . Small colleges would compete among themselves for the pleasure of it , not to train professional athletes and hype alumni and state legislators . If athletic scholarships were continued , their educational usefulness , not simply their athletic value , would need to be demonstrated . <p> For decades , on many campuses , fraternities and sororities have provided a second-best alternative to the residential college system in America . In their fraternity or sorority , students found the sense of community they craved , but which the college or university failed to provide . Indeed , the very existence of the Greek system may at least partially explain why so few colleges and universities have adopted the English residential college plan . <p> Obviously , restructuring higher education will be a long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as multimillion-dollar industrial conglomerates have outlived their usefulness and have given way to more creative adaptations , so too will large mega-university degree factories . It is not by chance alone that small colleges such as Amherst , Dartmouth , Middlebury , Mount Holyoke , Smith , Vassar , Wellesley , and Williams command premium prices in the marketplace . They charge high tuition because they provide a high value-added product . <p> By attempting to be all things to all people , large-scale universities have allowed their most important business -- undergraduate education -- to be seriously eroded .

Florida 's jagged , concave inner curve , if you swept assorted West Indies island bits and pieces along with it , locked boldly onto the north rim of South America , whose eastern edge , like any good jigsaw piece , snapped into place under the jutting bulge of West Africa .

Continental drift is one of those curious instances where the techniques of empirical science converge with a long-standing human tendency to project inner psychological contents -- images of wholeness , and ultimately of the self -- onto the physical contours of our planet . That this identification is an ancient one in Western culture , and that it continues to flourish long past its allotted historical moment , is the subject of this essay . <p> Representations of planet Earth as a topos of the human psyche derive from the pre-Enlightenment cosmological framework of sympathetic correspondences in which hierarchies of beings in an animate cosmos were believed to function equivalently : the heavens are mirrored , great to small , in the human body and ( especially once its roundness was established ) in Earth itself . Microcosm and macrocosm converge in the rotundum , the spherical container -- cosmos , globe , and human soul . Renaissance natural philosophers drew their notions directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Plato in the Timaeus , is a perfect living animal , feeding on its own waste , with no need of eyes or ears since there is nothing outside to see or hear , that also happens to possess the perfect form : " a sphere , without organs or limbs , rotating on its axis . " The Republic presents the cosmos as eight hollow concentric spheres set inside each other like " nested bowls " with Earth at the center . The celestial axis holds the Earth still while the three Fates at the North Pole -- apex of the Earth and its interface with the celestial axis and heaven -- wheel the spheres and their attached fixed stars around it . Here Plato also describes " openings in the sky " where souls depart after death and " openings in the earth " where they return to be reborn , later identified by the Neoplatonist Porphyry as the northernmost and southernmost points of the zodiac , or the apex and nadir of the heavens . <p> Though the idea of a round Earth would be abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained the concept of concentric circles to describe the relationship between our terrestrial regions and the heavens . Meanwhile the Platonic rotundum endured in Western consciousness in other forms . The Hellenistic sciences of the animate cosmos , alchemy and astrology , were preserved by Arab alchemists and widely disseminated in Europe after the twelfth century C.E. Through their experiments in transmuting " living " metals , the Christian and Muslim alchemists of Europe and the Middle East undertook the investigation of their own souls as well as their outer-world materials ; the steps of the Great Work that changed lead to gold , or the prima materia to the lapis or Philosopher 's Stone , were thought to work a similar effect on the experimenter 's psyche by creating a mystic unio between spirit and matter , a conjunction of the macrocosmic and microcosmic on a single plane of existence .

The physical features and sacral nature of the celestial spheres were increasingly downloaded , as it were , onto the orbis Terrarum ( Fig. 1 ) . As all the classical attributes of the cosmic spheres -- equator , tropics , and poles -- were transferred directly to the Earth , ontology became , in a very , literal way , geology . Ironically , even as the new sciences put the notion of an animate universe under active attack , the old guard found it no strain at all to fit a spherical Earth into the resonating symbolic framework of Pythagoras , Plato , and Ptolemy .

Just as the pole star was thought by the ancients to mark a hole in the heavens , the earthly poles were now believed to mark holes in the planet . In his Mundus subterraneus ( 1664 ) , the Jesuit Athanasius Kircher described ocean currents as subterranean waters rushing out of an enormous vortex at the South Pole to converge in a giant whirlpool that sucked them back under in a second hole at the North Pole ( Fig. 3 ) . In 1692 , the astronomer Edmund Halley advanced the theory that the Earth is composed of a series of inner concentric spheres capable of sustaining life . The most fascinating document of the rapidly expiring Platonic natural philosophy of this era , however , is Thomas Burnet 's Telluris sacra theoria ( 1689 ) , revised and expanded in an English version , The Sacred Theory of the Earth ( 1690/91 ) . Burnet , master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and John Tillotson , presented his explanation of the divine plan as manifested in the natural laws of Earth 's physical development . Regarded by its author as a devout work of " Christian geology " but by others as highly heretical , The Sacred Theory represents a last-ditch effort to bridge the widening gap between the old and new sciences . <p> Carrying through a tradition of medieval Christian Neoplatonism out of Pythagoreanism , Burner describes Earth as a " Mundane Egg , " with the shell the Earth 's ernst and its interior the yolk . He posits an historical sequence of three Earths : first , out of Chaos , an original Edenic orb that was a fixed star , a Platonic rotundum of unblemished smoothness and regularity ; then the present " broken Globe " whose continents , crevices , mountains and other irregularities are a consequence of its humanlike Fall ( a sixteen-hundred-year process of geological " moral degeneration " in which a flood erupted from waters already lying within the hollow Earth ) ; and finally a third millennial Earth , restored to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resurrected righteous will rule for a thousand years until , after a final epic fire , the planet will metamorphose once again into a fixed star . <p> It is alchemy as implicit subtext , however , that rules the metaphorical structure of The Sacred Theory . In the story of Burnet 's planet , whose rivers flow like arterial blood and whose fissures embody moral decay , we see geological , cultural , and spiritual transmutations nostalgically coincide . The cyclic births and deaths of Burnet 's first and second Earth are virtually identical with the transmutation process , and the Earth itself makes an ideal crucible . The perfection of this Edenic Earth is ruptured by a Kircherian " Great Abysse " near the Pole that unleashes subterranean waters onto the Earth 's surface in an alchemical dissolutio or Flood to produce the split-apart land masses of its present fallen state ( Fig. 4 ) . After purging in a " Refiner 's fire , " Earth will be transmuted by a coniunctio of earthly and divine into its ultimate lapis status as a fixed star . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision of planet Earth also functions as a kind of sacred theory of the psyche . Within the individual human , the apocalyptic sequence occurs as a profound interior transformation of the personality . Much like the tree-cum-Cross protagonist of the Old English Dream of the Rood , Earth is a character whose progress we follow in a bildungsroman narrative of high adventure . Its fall from rotundum to " mighty Ruine " mirrors the human misfortune , its continental drift the emergence of the specific personal topography of character that spoils the perfect regularity of the undifferentiated prelapsarian soul . Both self and globe will regain their perfection after the Resurrection . Winding up his story , Burnet bids an affectionate goodbye , as to a familiar figure : " There we leave Earth ; Having conducted it for the space of Seven Thousand Years , through various changes from a dark Chaos to a bright Star . " <p> The intertwined apocalyptic destiny of self and globe , as we will see , is a theme Burnet 's literary heirs in the twentieth century will often return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Burnet as a redactor of the old science was already a marginal figure . From the next century 's perspective , Erasmus Darwin 's syncretic conceits in The Botanic Garden ( 1791 ) -- his millennial vision , for example , of " Nymphs " towing icebergs to the equator to equalize the climates , thereby allowing Earth to return to its Edenic state -- would seem even quainter . For eighteenth-century Westerners , alchemy and the sympathetic identifications had been increasingly exiled to the realm of ornamental metaphor and -- for wits like Pope -- outright satire . Though Neoplatonic metaphors continued to exert a strong influence on the new empiricists and vestiges of the old Naturphilosophie would be revived by Goethe , Humboldt , and others well into the nineteenth century , after the Renaissance " the means of internalizing the cosmos , " as Ernest Tuveson has said , would be " by the aesthetic " rather than natural science . We must look to literary , not scientific , descendants of Fluddian natural philosophy for the continuing identification of self with globe and cosmos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary genre of mystical geography out of the same mixture of Christian and classical sources drawn on by the old sciences . From Dante to John Bunyan , the quest literature of Christianity had always boasted authors who , much like the classical and medieval mnemonists , created their own special kind of inner topography . In the concrete allegory of these narratives , outer and inner worlds describe each other ; the spiritual journey enacts itself in the physical journey , and vice versa . Unlike the discourse of natural philosophy , however , the underlying terms of this literary genre were not immediately -- and in some eases , never -- erased by the rapidly changing philosophical , religious , and scientific worldview of the Enlightenment and later . From the Romantic era on , this Neoplatonic tradition would be carried on in a distinct group of literary sea and adventure narratives that , while ostensibly imitating the real feats of Western explorers circumnavigating the globe , became the vehicle for a new kind of soul quest through the geocosm . <p> " O vast Rondure , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to identity himself as " a Kosmos " ) , PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> The new secularized quest narratives embodied considerably more than " passage to India , " however . Now as earlier , this spiritualizing of physical geography would require that the journey be undertaken by real people and start at a quantifiable point in time and space in the physical world precisely in order to end up in an internalized soul region outside time and space . Using the topographical allegorizing of the religious narratives , they would also oblige their readers to employ , within their own interpretative process , the analogic principles of the old discarded science . For the Romantics and their literary heirs , the artist became Robert Fludd 's Pan who fashions a world that is the perfect mirror of his own insides . Coleridge and Poe would imagine their journeys in a Hermetic mode , creating visionary landscapes in which elements are first hypothesized , then appear ; possibilities are entertained , then materialize . What M. H. Abrams called the Romantics ' " habitual reading of passion , life and physiognomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions of the Imago Mundi as a mirror of the human soul , contributes the same Demiurgic framing to what I have called elsewhere " psychotopographic literature " of the twentieth century , expressionist fiction in which , naively or deliberately , inner psychic processes are projected sympathetically onto an exterior landscape . <p> Nowhere is this complicated Renaissance heritage more strikingly apparent than in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Western fictional narratives of journeys to the Poles , and particularly ( because of its greater remoteness ) to the South Pole . The historical path of this identification follows the same development as that for the Earth generally . Pole began as an astronomical term ( Greek polos , axis or sky , Latin polus ) , first as the entire axis of the celestial sphere , then as the two fixed points in the celestial sphere around which the stars seemed to revolve . By the sixteenth century , pole signified the two points at which the earth 's axis met the celestial sphere . ( Similarly , Arktos the Bear , the northern constellation , and anti-Arktos , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earth their names . ) <p> The term pole was also extended to each of the two opposite points on the surface of a magnet , which aligns itself north-south . The magnetic poles of the earth are these two points in the North and South Poles , respectively , where the compass needle takes a vertical position . The magnet , of course , was a crucial tool for mariners in finding their way ( lodestone , the old word for magnet , means literally " way-stone " ) . Thus the Poles , in both their " true " and " magnetic " manifestations , are orienting points . In microcosmic terms , this means they are the orienting loci of the psyche , but by the same token they are also the least known , the farthest from consciousness , the points ( inherent in the notion of polarity ) where the transcendent and celestial spheres have special access to the human sphere . <p> This association is reinforced in Western fantastic representations across the centuries that present the outer , geographic Poles as either Hells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the inhabited part of the Earth , in a northern temperate zone that had a southern counterpart , the " Antipodes , " on the lower side of the sphere -- a region the Pythagoreans had earlier dubbed the " Antiehthones " because they believed it to be a separate celestial body , an alter orbis completely distinct from our planet . Lucretius and other ancient commentators , however , derided the idea of an inhabited southern area because their position on the sphere ( literally " antipodes " ) would oblige these people to hang upside down by their feet . Nonetheless , the belief in a large southern land region led Ptolemy in the second century C.E. to posit the " Terra Australis Incognita , " a southern continent completely enclosing the Indian Ocean -- an hypothesis that would be accepted as geographical fad for the next fifteen hundred years . <p> The tradition of the Antichthones and Antipodes as a region of reversals contra naturam was similarly transferred into medieval Christian geography : Higden 's fourteenth-century Polychronicon , for example , contains a mappemonde detailing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fariei , Virgogiei , Troglodytes " ) ' , in Paradise Lost Milton located a " frozen continent " in Hell . Even as late as the eighteenth century , Shaftesbury could comment , about his map of nature : " In the places most remote from man 's works and occupations we encounter the manifestation of the divine Mind pure and undefiled . " Out of this tradition comes the implicit identification of the Poles with the furthest unknown reaches of the self/world and , for that very reason , with its transcendent center as well . For what is farthest away and most hidden is , paradoxically , always what is most important : the journey to the pole is a journey to the center of the soul . <p> A mystic or occult notion of both Poles also figures strongly in alchemists ' speculations about the resonating inner and outer worlds . C. G. Jung -- the twentieth century 's only notable Hermetic philosopher disguised as a psychologist , and not coincidentally a fervent student of alchemical literature -- uncovered numerous references to the Poles in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Philalethes " asserts that since the magnet has a hidden center which turns toward the Pole , thus <p> in the Pole is found the heart of Mercurius , which is the true fire wherein its Lord has his rest . He who journeys through this great and wide sea may touch at both Indies , may guide his course by the sight of the North Star , which our Magnet will cause to appear to you . <p> Jung interprets this passage as a description of the psyche 's irresistible journey or impetus toward wholeness , that is , <p> the Deus absconditus ( hidden God ) who dwells at the North Pole and reveals himself through magnetism . His other synonym is mercurius , whose heart is to be found at the Pole , and who guides men on the perilous voyage over the sea of the world . The idea is that the whole machinery of the world is driven by the infernal life at the North Pole , that this is hell , and that hell is a system of upper powers reflected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Pole " was " a cross from which the four directions radiate " ; that the quest to reach the Pole is symbolic of striving for " wholeness as the goal to which the ' archaic appetite ' points , the magnetic north which gives the traveller his bearings on the ' sea of the world . ' " <p> In the sharply diverging post-Enlightenment histories of natural philosophy and nautical exploration , however , we may safely identify a single shared moment of harmonic convergence : Sunday , 30 December 1774 , when Captain James Cook on his journey to the Southern Ocean in the Adventure reached latitude 71 10 's . In place of Ptolemy 's Terra Australis Incognita and a mystic circulus australis there was now a real Antarctic Circle , and a real ship had just penetrated it . Deciding because of the " immense Icefields " that he " could not proceed one Inch farther South , " however , Cook concluded there was no southern land mass enclosing the Indian Ocean from the south . <p> Samuel Taylor Coleridge had read Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume of his Neoplatonic muses " Iamblichus , Proclus , Psellus , and Hermes Trismegistus " that he purchased in x796 and carried everywhere in his pocket . Whereas Mary Shelley would have her Frankenstein 's Creature disappear into the " darkness and distance " of the Arctic , the South Pole 's greater remoteness seduced Coleridge sufficiently to transpose his extensive readings in Arctic literature to the Southern Ocean when he composed The Rime of the Ancient Mariner , first published in 1798 in Lyrical Ballads and revised in 1800 . <p> Universally recognized as " the travelogue of a spiritual journey , " the Ancient Mariner is a profoundly alchemical and elemental poem that most closely resembles the medieval dream vision whose landscape provides fixed points for meditation and self-reflection . Coleridge 's unique amalgam of physical and soul journey was to set the pattern of the southern journey for his many imitators in Western literature : an archetypal sea-trip from a bustling port ( consciousness ) to Terra Australis Ineognita ( unconsciousness ) , where a transcendental encounter occurs that initiates either integration of the self or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In a not surprising convergence of influences , the poem begins with a quote from Burnet 's Archaeologiae Philosophicae attesting to the reality of Neoplatonic spirits in the air around us . In Burnetian ( or even Miltonian ) terms , if humans lost their inner vision at the Fall , a journey to the Pole must involve an initial failure to recognize that the journey has an esoteric as well as an exoteric meaning ; this failure must produce catastrophe followed by suffering and eventual redemption . And this is exactly what happens in the Ancient Mariner : a man blind to his inner spirit ( the albatross ) kills it , but is redeemed when he experiences love for God 's creatures ( the sea-snakes ) as his ship or body journeys on the larger Body of the globe , pushed by angelic forces in a harrowing voyage of self-discovery . Ultimately , the " lonesome Spirit from the south pole " guides the mariner 's boat back to civilization , where it sinks in a maelstrom , leaving him the sole survivor . ( This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encounter with an ill-omened white creature . ) The journey to the furthest unknown recesses of the psyche discovers a positive force there that supports the ego 's act of self-redemption . We take it as a good psychotopographic sign that the sinking occurs dose to the Ekemene , home base in Europe , because that suggests the experience inflicted on the mariner is more accessible to his ( and the reader 's ) consciousness than any action taking place at the Pole itself . <p> In the two voices of the Ancient Mariner -- one a pre-Shakespearean sixteenth-century balladeer and the other his Percylike antiquarian commentator , from roughly Burnet 's time -- Coleridge 's obvious strategy , as Jerome McGann and others have shown , is to reproduce not just the flavor of an archaic ballad , but a sense , as in the Old and New Testaments , of multiple textual layers . In fact , the poem amounts to a kind of self-contained Burnetian geological process of its own , a little evolving world of complex textual strata . As in The Sacred Theory , cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The contrasting layers reinforce our sense of the poem and its craggy fissures as no perfect rotundum but a self-conscious and all-too-human Burnetian " mighty Ruine . " <p> When Edgar Allan Poe 's The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym was published in 1838 , the same year that the U.S.-sponsored Wilkes expedition departed for the Southern Ocean , the Antarctic continent had still not been reached , and its very existence was uncertain . Poe , like Coleridge , drew heavily on explorers ' accounts , but even more heavily on the old notions of the animate universe : in the warm waters he bestows on the Antarctic Ocean we see the classical legends of the warm waters of Hyperborea , the land behind the North Wind . More specifically , he uses the then-popular theories of John Cleves Symmes , an army captain turned natural philosopher who postulated a hollow earth composed of five concentric spheres ( projecting the structure of the Ptolemaic cosmos , as the Renaissance natural philosophers did , directly onto Earth ) accessible through holes near the North and South Poles . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Symzonia : A Voyage of Discovery ( 1820 ) , by " Captain Adam Seaborn , " probably Symmes himself . Considered the first piece of American utopian fiction , Symzonia describes Captain Seaborn 's most American determination to discover a " new and untried world " because " the resources of the known world have been exhausted by research , its wealth monopolized , its wonders of curiosity explored , its every thing investigated and understood ! " He navigates his custom-built steamboat to a temperate southern land mass and follows a wide river pouring into a hole at the South Pole to the first of the five layered concentric spheres ( Fig. 5 ) . In this land ( which " out of gratitude to Capt . Symmes for his sublime theory " he names Symzonia ) Seaborn finds a perfect democracy of albino humans governed by a council of Worthies and a Best Man . <p> Symmes 's theory of the hollow earth was enthusiastically propagated by his follower J. N. Reynolds , whose treatises on the South Pole were both reviewed by Poe and inserted verbatim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bailey once suggested , might just as easily have been titled Pymzonia ) . Widely disseminated in the early nineteenth century , Symmes 's notions passed into popular folklore as the polar " Symmes Hole , " a belief that kept its currency among hollow earth cultists in America and Europe well into the twentieth century . In 1906 a sixteen-year-old H. P. Lovecraft wrote a letter to the Providence Daily Journal to refute the theory advanced in a new book , The Phantom of the Poles , " that the earth is a hollow sphere , with openings at the poles . " ( It is typical of his contradictory conscious and unconscious agendas that this writer , who prided himself on the rigor of his " scientific materialist " views , went on to create , with enormous gusto , just such a Kircherian globe in his own fictions . ) Even after World War II -- as Joseelyn Godwin details in his fascinating study Arktos -- a popular myth arose that Hitler had survived the war in a subterranean Antarctic labyrinth with a legion of flying saucers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own predilections toward the vortex that made the Symmes Hole a perfect fit with the inner structure of his psyche . For even more than the Ancient Manner , Pym is an imagined story in the full sense of the world . In Poe 's only novel , action must be imaginatively anticipated before it can be made manifest , events seem only to proceed while the first-person narrator lies in a swoon , and Pym awakens each time to find himself regressed into ever more outrageously claustrophobic and life-threatening predicaments . This repetitive retreat into lowered or obliterated consciousness is a microcosmic journey to his own self 's Terra Incognita , an ongoing dress rehearsal of the outer journey that will end so obscurely . In the macrocosmic terms of the larger narrative , the apocalypse that Pyre and his comrades rush toward in their small boat ( a structurally equivalent act to that chronicled in his stories " MS Found in a Bottle " and " Descent into the Maelstrom " ) is also the vortex in the unconscious toward which the conscious ego feels both attraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are congruent and resonate sympathetically . In the symbolic terms of Poe 's magic cosmos throughout his literary works , falling into a hole or pit is the transforming moment of death , and this recurring private and personal Symmes Hole becomes the inevitable destination in both the smaller and larger predicaments of Pym . It is the reason that Poe can provide no depiction of the South Pole itself , or of Pym 's reaching it . <p> Pym presents its own complicated pastiche of textual fragments recounted by at least three narrators , two of whom are unidentified . " Tekeli'li ! " one anonymous commentator obligingly recaps for us after Pym 's own account abruptly breaks off , " was the cry of the affrighted natives of Tsalal upon discovering the carcass of the white animal picked up at sea . " It was also , he continues , <p> the shuddering exclamation of the captive Tsalalian upon encountering the white materials in possession of Mr. Pym . This also was the shriek of the swift-flying , white , and gigantic birds which issued from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant white birds Poe is echoing Coleridge 's albatross , but he engages a " polarity " as well : the black island of Tslalal that intrudes itself before the whiteness . <p> The commentator , however , fails to mention the most striking manifestation of whiteness , namely , the giant " shrouded human figure " with snow-white skin who rises before Pym and his companion Dirk Peters out of the ashy cataract filling the southern polar sky . In Poe , as in Coleridge before him , these mysterious white figures embody the transcendental and unearthly dimension of the southern polar region . In Pym , however , does this figure represent the Anthropos , the macrocosmic Original Man of Gnostic and Jewish belief , as Richard Howard has proposed ? Or is perhaps the globe itself the true Anthropos here and the giant figure merely its microcosmic equivalent ? The enigmatic , open-ended narrative leaves readers looking over the edge of the Great Abyss with no clear view of what lies below . <p> We may note in passing that when Herman Melville drew on Pym for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only very briefly ) , and so his descriptions of the landscape of the Southern Ocean are considerably less shadowy and mythic than those of the armchair sailors Poe and Coleridge . Melville 's greater involvement in the world of the senses makes his characters ' pursuit of the whiteness an outer world journey first and an inner world journey by extension rather than the other way around . It is no coincidence , consequently , that Melville 's Anthropos turns out to be a marine mammal , a creature of the elemental world rather than a daemon of the next sphere up . <p> As the nineteenth century wore on , the Romantic world view suffered its own continental drift into the Victorian sentimentality of Arthur Conan Doyle on one hand -- whose supernatural story " The Captain of the ' Pole-star ' " ( 1883 ) , in which a tormented ship 's captain meets his end on an Arctic ice floe , pursuing a white insubstantial female form ( presumably the ghost of his dead fiancee back in Comwall ) , contains more than an echo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the techno-literalism of Jules verne in works like The Sphinx of the Ice Fields ( 1897 ) , which Verne composed , according to William Butcher , not only to " completely superimpose itself on Poe 's novel but also to cover it so completely as to virtually block it out . " The mysterious Sphinx that Verne 's explorers are seeking at the South Pole turns out to be a giant magnet that strips their vessel of all its iron ; pinned to the lodestone by a stray musket is none other than the frozen corpse of the explorer Arthur Gordon Pym . This decidedly nonoccult echo of Robert Fludd is typical of Verne 's framing consciousness of nineteenth-century scientific materialism . <p> Much closer in spirit to Poe 's mythic journey is Verne 's Journey to the Center of the Earth ( 1864 ) , in which scientists retrace the route of a sixteenth-century Icelandic alchemist reminiscent of Athanasius Kircher ( who , though no alchemist , once had himself lowered by ropes into Vesuvius to observe an eruption firsthand ) . Entering the mundus subterraneus through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands and oceans and are ultimately ejected in an eruption onto the island of Stromboli ( earnestly asking a local boy , " Is this the North Pole ? " because their compass has been magnetically reversed ) . Although Verne , like his closest twentieth-century equivalent , the English writer J. G. Ballard , flirts with the sympathetic connections in his primal topographies , the deeper possibility of the " journey to the center of the self , " simply because the narrative stays literalized on the level of physical geography , remains unconscious . Verne 's sensibility proved the enduring trend as it helped initiate the popular genre of science fiction , which rationalized the supernatural into " marvelous machines " capable of accomplishing feats formerly performed by angels , nymphs , and Neoplatonic daemons . <p> A century after Poe , a proponent of the new popular fantastic fiction , H. P. Lovecraft , wrote as both a child of this materialist movement and a rebel against it .

The narrator of Lovecraft 's tale is a geologist who has brought to the Antarctic a remarkable new drill that can go to unplumbed depths .

Here , finally , the hole at the Pole definitively converges with the proverbial " hole in the head " signifying madness .

We arrive here as we are in reality , and when that reality is revealed to us -- that part of our reality which we would prefer to pass over in silence -- then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , is the classic postcolonialist argument : if the Western imagination does no more than project its own psychic Terra Incognita onto the rest of Earth , then we correctly regard such accounts of these regions as portraits of an alter ego , not an alter orbis . The colonialist 's psychotopographic presumption is to seek the Other and find only his own reflection . Solaris presents the exquisite joke that , for once , rejected contents of the psyche are projected onto an Other who is having none of it and -- to the total psychological undoing of the projectors -- reflects these contents right back to them . <p> Inevitably , the planet Solaris is discovered to contain , Chinese box style , its own alter orbis . As Kelvin and the other scientists move the station toward the planet 's southern polar region , they try beaming Kelvin 's own brain waves into the ocean . Of this same region an earlier scientist , whose suppressed testimony is preserved only in lost notebooks ( significantly nicknamed the " Little Apocrypha " ) , testifies that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean after an astronaut falls in it . Is this , as some hypothesize , the ocean 's representation of an artifact of the drowned man 's memory ? Possibly so , but Robert Fludd had this to say on the subject of " polarity " in alchemy : <p> The two polar fundamental principles of the universe are form as the light principle , coming from above , and matter as the dark principle , dwelling in the earth .... In the middle , the sphere of the sun , where these opposing principles just counterbalance each other , there is engendered in the mystery of the chymic wedding the infans Solaris , which is at the same time the liberated world-soul . <p> The ocean , our highly erudite author Lem may be suggesting , could be producing the possibilities of an alchemical coniunctio , or mystic union of spirit and matter , a philosopher 's stone of its own . But what , exactly , does the baby , this " child of the sun , " consist of ? Is it materialized spirit or spiritualized matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion of material imagination as he comes to see the ocean as an " imperfect " or " evolving " god " whose passion is not a redemption , who saves nothing , fulfills no purpose -- a god who simply is . " In his highly alchemical definition , " this God has no existence outside of matter . He would like to free himself from matter , but he can not . " Hoping to maintain his tenuous connection to transcendence through the strait gate of his now fully accepted love , pain , and loss , Kelvin decides to remain on Solaris . <p> The mystic geography of Thomas Pynchon 's V. ( 1963 ) also owes a great deal to Renaissance natural philosophy . In one of the novel 's intricately interwoven subplots , the English explorer Hugh Godolphin , sent on a routine mapping expedition into the heart of Asia , stumbles upon the land of Vheissu , the first letter of whose name , in this novel 's terms , signals its membership in a macrocosmic hidden pattern that shapes human events all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region whose physical features have the magical ability to change color constantly , like a " tattooed skin " ; its emblematic indigenous species is an iridescent spider monkey . Haunted by visions of Vheissu , Godolphin journeys to its direct opposite , the South Pole . There , " at one of the only two motionless places on this gyratic world " ( " a country , " he adds simply , " the demiurge had forgotten " ) , he discovers , shimmering through several feet of transparent ice , the body of one of Vheissu 's spider monkeys . <p> Besides representing the now-familiar millennial convergence of tropics and pole , this image recalls the display of colors associated with the albedo or whitening , the first major transformation in the alchemical process . Yet we learn that this impossible juxtaposition , " the rainbow-colored spider monkey buried beneath the zero point of absolute stasis , " is only a cruel parody of the mystic unio . An unnamed " They , " says Godolphin , deliberately planted it for him to find , as a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simply an amusing fabrication of theirs . If this is the ease , then whose fabricated world do Godolphin and all the rest of us live in ? Another character speculates on the identity of these mysterious demiurges . " A barbaric and unknown race , " he says , <p> employed by God knows whom , are even now blasting the Antarctic ice with dynamite , preparing to enter a subterranean network of natural tunnels , a network whose existence is known only to the inhabitants of Vheissu , the Royal Geographic Society in London , Herr Godolphin , and the spies of Florence . <p> In the elaborate tapestry of V. , the rulers of the sublunary sphere are able to elude identification by hiding behind the visible pattern of the natural world . ( Or , conversely , in a familiar modernist twist , they may represent no more than the speaker 's own paranoid fantasies . ) <p> Warning humans off visiting their Antipodean regions , as Lovecraft and Pynchon both do , may seem a sensible strategy -- Coleridge , after all , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Centre to live in the Circumference " -- but what of the psyche/globe whose fate is to have its poles invade its central regions ? Here we see the polar quest diverging into two distinct types of journeys cure inner experience : going to the Pole and falling into the mundus subterraneus on one hand or , on the other , having the Poles invade the Ekumene , the center of consciousness , in such a way that the ego experiences either demonic conversion ( death or psychosis ) or a blissful mystical experience . <p> Using the macro-micro polar topos for very different purposes , two British writers , Leonora Carrington and Anna Kavan , employ this second type of mystic journey by sending the ice to their protagonists instead of the other way around . This inversion of the polar ice caps amounts to a translation of the psyche/globe into a transcendent Platonic form that delivers Eden or death , and in both works the globe paradoxically reaches its Burnetian regularized perfection by virtue of the solid sheath of ice encasing it . ( The reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unbearable heat -- informs J. G. Ballard 's 1963 novel The Drowned World . ) <p> In Ice ( 1967 ) , by Anna Kayan ( a name its bearer adopted in homage to Kafka ) , massive glaciers relentlessly encroach on Earth 's temperate zones , possibly as an unexpected result of nuclear testing . Kavan 's main character is an embodied Coleridgean Life-in-Death -- a nameless albino young woman with snowy white hair and skin transparent as glass who moves from one landscape of sadism to another in a world that is dying of frost . The " girl 's " mute passivity , we are told , is the result of being bullied by a sadistic mother ( as Kayan herself claimed to have been ) . The male narrator , symbiotic alter ego of the brutal men to whom this woman is in thrall , pursues her through one vaguely totalitarian state after another in a phantasmagoric narrative in which points of view and lines of narrative are constantly shifting . In simultaneous parallel stories , the brutalized girl is resurrected from death and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a rollercoaster ride to death . <p> Kavan 's bleak millennial vision communicates powerful excitement about the coming Armageddon . The destruction of life is represented as an enthralling , highly dynamic process : <p> Dazzling ice stars bombarded the earth with rays , which splintered and penetrated the earth , filling earth 's core with their deadly coolness , reinforcing the cold of the advancing ice . And always , on the surface , the indestructible ice-mass was moving forward , implacably destroying all life . <p> The Earth Kavan is describing is a Burnetian sphere , of course ; even allowing such an event as " ice stars " pelting the planet with their freezing rays , it would be impossible , in real world terms , for ice to penetrate the Earth 's core and freeze it from the inside out . Rather , Kavan is giving us a pathetic fallacy description of a seductive , welcomed , apocalyptic death taking place at the center of one person 's soul and physical body as well as in the outside world : <p> Frozen by the deathly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of crystalline ice-light , she felt herself becoming part of the polar vision , her structure becoming one with the structure of ice and snow . As her fate , she accepted the world of ice , shining , shimmering , dead ; she resigned herself to the triumph of glaciers and the death of her world . Addicted to heroin , Kavan died of its effects in 1968 , age sixty-seven . One may draw the obvious parallels between the street name for heroin , the novel 's title , and the destruction of the world represented within it . The world and the woman are the same entity ; the body of the planet is her body ; man 's sadistic misuse of both has resulted in their deaths . Perversely , this is also an erotic fulfillment . <p> Leonora Carrington 's shifting polar caps in The Hearing Trumpet ( 1977 ) provide a millennial vision as playful and life expanding as Anna Kavan 's are death dealing . Carrington , an English painter whose fiction and art have not received the recognition owed them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which an elderly expatriate in Mexico , Marion Leatherby , is consigned by her son to a peculiar old folks ' home ( whose quirky buildings serve as an expressionistic extension of the inhabitants ' own psyches ) run by a Gurdjieffian tyrant . In the course of the entirely unsummarizable plot , Marion and the other old ladies , organized by their secret leader the black servant Christabel , stage a personal revolt , with the macrocosmic result of their invocation of a three-headed Goddess being nothing less than the exchange of the poles with the equator and the release of a winged hermaphrodite called the Sephira ( a syncretic version of Isaiah 's six-winged seraph , here the result of the union of the Devil with a priestess of the old religion disguised as a nun ) from the tower of our heroine 's own psyche . In such a cataclysmic manner -- as wolves and glaciers joyously invade the tropics -- is Marion 's initial forlorn wish to visit Lapland triumphantly fulfilled . <p> Very much in the spirit of Erasmus Darwin 's eccentric vision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows the protagonist of this psychic navigation to avoid the perils of both the overwhelmed consciousness ( as represented by Poe , Lovecraft , and Kavan ) and the colonizing consciousness ( as represented by Lem ) . Here the invasion of consciousness by the remote and rejected regions of the psyche creates an icy Eden instead of Lovecraft 's and Kavan 's icy Hell . Marion Leatherby stands still while the Poles ( herself , or her Self , the innermost core of her being , representing the true Pole ) rise to meet consciousness in an ultimately benevolent encounter . At the climax Marion descends into a mundus subterraneus below the old folks ' home where she dies and -- after an alchemical cooking in a bubbling cauldron/rotundum stirred by her alter ego -- is reborn a greatly enlarged human . This death and rebirth represent the correct outcome of the alchemical work : the mystic unio which results in the shrinking of the Terra Incognita and corresponding enlargement of the " inhabited areas " of the psyche . Self , globe , and cosmos are realigned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consciousness and unconsciousness . <p> After Carrington and Kavan , do any more polar literary icicles remain to be harvested ? Quite a few , in fact , though with one exception they can not be covered here . Though its narrative framework is one of more straightforward realism , the same strands of thinking are visible in a short vignette in William Golding 's trilogy about a converted British warship on its perilous voyage through the South Ocean . In Fire Down Below ( 1989 ) , the concluding volume of this underrated masterpiece -- misread by reviewers as , among other things , a " great sentimental journey of the naval kind " -- the motley flock of passengers are Gnostic scintillae Dei whose microcosmically flickering souls resonate with the smoldering keelson in the bowels of the ship that threatens to rend apart at any moment . At one point before the ship reaches safe harbor in Australia , a calving , spinning iceberg ( whose " dull and fitful gleam " the narrator first mistakes for the dawn ) manifests as an enormous " cliff " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossibly , rotates around it . As , in another optical illusion , the berg seems to rush past the ship instead of the other way around , the narrator tells us he " saw a melange of visions in the ice which swept past me -- figures trapped in the ice , my father among them . " Golding 's ship of self has had a quick brush with the capricious Polar Spirit , who obligingly offers the ego/narrator a tantalizingly quick glimpse into the Narcissus pool orbis own unconscious . <p> The notion of psychological projection , our secularized humancentered construction of the old trope of sympathetic correspondences , now insists that the macrocosm reflects the microcosm instead of the other way around -- a development some of the old Renaissance heretics might well have applauded , since it locates the divine squarely within the human . In these terms , then , the inner wastes of Antarctica have provided a beautifully blank projective screen for post-Enlightenment writers and poets . Out of the Symmes Hole of their imaginations have crawled -- among other creatures -- the Polar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a huge magnet , snail-like monsters and their star-headed masters , an enormous baby , a winged hermaphrodite , a victimized albino woman , and a multicolored monkey . <p> In Ice , his admirable study of the Antarctic , Stephen J. Pyne claims that now , at the close of the twentieth century , the era of the polar Gothic has also ended : " Once Antarctica and the ocean basins had been generally explored , there were no unvisited geographies within which to set a lost civilization ; fantasy writing had to resurrect old problems , tour other planets , or plunge into the depths of the human soul . " But even as we see this projective mechanism working in a novel like Solaris , it seems likely that our mapped , explored , satellite circumnavigated and much photographed Whole Earth will continue to exert its macrocosmic seductions on the human psyche . Robert Fludd would not find much to quarrel with in the present-day construct of the ecological food chain , a telluric-projected revival of the old cosmogony 's catena aurea , nor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antarctica , widely believed in our age to leave humans nakedly exposed to malign ultraviolet radii from the heavens , is another perfect replication of Ptolemaic cosmology ( Fig. 7 ) . Empirically verifiable it may certainly be , but the polar hole is also a venerable construct of Western culture . <p> Popular storytelling continues to feed this symbolically rendered need . The two Hollywood film versions of The Thing , set in the Arctic and Antarctic respectively , belong to the category of the Other who emerges from the Pole , the desert , under the sea , and all other regions of inner wilderness outside the realm of consciousness . The 1956 Mole People , in which albino descendants of the Sumerians are discovered under a volcano , features a " scientific " introduction by Hollywood 's favorite professor Frank Baxter , who cheerfully cites Symmes and other worthies in defense of a hollow earth . In Peter Weir 's The Last Wave ( 1978 ) , Australian aborigines foretell in their dreams the next great Flood , a cataclysm produced by " giant low pressure from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Langoliers ( 1994 ) features a planeload of people who leave sublunary space and time when they fly through a polar aurora borealis that mysteriously appears in the Midwestern skies ; Kevin Reynolds 's Waterworld ( 1995 ) depicts an Earth in which the ice caps melt and the poles reverse to produce a lawless anti-Edenic oceanic planet . And this year will see the publication of a new blockbuster adventure novel , Subterranean , by James Clemens , " about a group of adventurers who travel to the underground center of Antarctica . " <p> In these formulaic narratives , the level of the inner psychological journey remains submerged and unconscious , though we sense intuitively that it is there , just as when as a child I felt the click of the uniting continents . A catharsis of this sort stays locked in reflexive instinct , lacking the fullness of discovery that a completely realized work of art allows . Yet humans never cease in their efforts to bring about the impossible union . The pull we feel the Polar Spirit exerting on us to go to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , of course . Although Antarctica continues to be earnestly depicted in documentaries and news reports as " a continent devoted to science , " its less allowable representations flourish in a different territory of the human psyche , a region where we have never stopped trying to tow the Poles into our temperate zones . <p> Because if the old woman ca n't go to Lapland it means that Lapland must come to the old woman . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Tenniel 's illustration of the anti-Beetonian household . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Fig. 1 .

@@4000941 The expression " sent up the river " finds its roots in New York penal history . From the early 1800s on , convicted felons from New York City were literally " sent up the river " to Sing Sing , the gloomy penitentiary perched above the banks of the Hudson River at Ossining . <p> My arrival there was July 17 , 1985 , after receiving a fifteen years to life sentence under New York state 's Rockefeller drug laws . To my eyes , when the transport bus stopped in front of the gates , the view of the river was awesome , spreading out from the prison like a smooth , still carpet . The contrast of the natural beauty of the surroundings and the daunting facade of Sing Sing was mind-boggling . Then , once inside , as the bus inched past the giant concrete wall , I looked up and saw gun towers with armed guards . Seagulls circled high above , giving the prison the look of a medieval castle . <p> In the heart of the prison complex was the state shop , where new jacks ( prison speak for new inmates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me on the bus , were taken off and steered like cattle into a holding pen . Our cuffs and chains were removed and , one by one , we were called to another room where we were reunited with our property and given our cell assignments . <p> I was assigned to B Block . With some 660 prisoners , this is reputed to be the world 's largest cellblock . To get there we had to travel past other parts of the prison . Long , concrete corridors and tunnels connected Sing Sing 's many buildings , most of which were in horrendous condition . Slabs of peeling paint hung from the ceilings . A thin film of moisture , residue from the nearby river , covered the battleship-gray walls . The smell of mildew , disinfectant , and body odor from the 2,300 men who filled the prison made me nauseated . <p> At several checkpoints along the way we stopped while guards known as turnkeys opened the steel gates that were strategically placed throughout the facility . Prisoners could n't travel beyond these checkpoints without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 yards and countless steel gates later a door swung open and I took my first steps into B Block . <p> The noise hit me like a freight train . Rap music from radios hanging on cell bars blasted throughout the tiers . Prisoners shouted at one another from across the rows of cages stacked one on top of another , four stories high . The voices of hundreds of convicts ricocheted off the steel bars , creating a thunderous din . The block resembled a giant airplane hangar full of human cargo . <p> While I stood there , stunned , another set of gates opened . A guard led us to a cell that had been converted into an office for the officer in charge . This OIC ran the daffy activities of the block and attended to the custodial upkeep of the prisoners who lived there . I was astonished by the enormity of his task . As I gazed out over the tiers , I saw prisoners running buck wild up and down the corridors , hanging out in each other 's cells , shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filthy , raucous , and crowded . <p> The cell I was assigned was a windowless , fifty-four square foot solid metal cube , number W-429 . It contained a small bed with steel springs and a torn , piss-stained mattress . A toilet with an old , porcelain bowl squatted in the corner next to a small metal locker . A portable lamp with a built-in electrical outlet was clamped over the bed . Graffiti covered the walls . I threw my property sack on the floor , sat on the bed , which was more like a cot , and held my head in my hands to drown out the noise . <p> Shortly after , a guard cracked the cell gates , signaling it was time for lunch . I followed a group of prisoners to the mess hall and took my position in line . This place was as loud and confusing as the cellblock . Hundreds of prisoners , some eating , some leaving , some standing in line , filled the massive , high-ceilinged room . At one point I made the mistake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , motherfucker ! " he screamed in my face . " What 's wrong with you ? Do n't ever reach over my food again or I 'll kill you . " <p> I backed away and apologized . I learned quickly that this gesture , like so many others in prison , was a sign of disrespect . The subculture there carried its own set of rules , known as the " convict code , " which prisoners lived and died by . The best that a new jack could do was to learn the code as quickly as possible and pray that in the meantime his rookie mistakes would n't get him murdered . <p> One of the worst parts about life as a new jack was being checked out by all the other prisoners . Not having a crew was dangerous . The prison was infested with predators and scam artists searching for men who had n't hooked up with a gang for protection . B Block was more dangerous than the other blocks because it was a transit-housing unit . Prisoners were constantly coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be moving out so they lived for the moment , not caring about anything or anyone . <p> The way for a new jack to protect himself was to join a crew and find safety in numbers . Some inmates joined racial gangs for protection , but you could find just about any kind of group to hang with to show that you were n't doing time solo . You 'd start by playing basketball or handball with someone , then meeting his friends . If they liked you , you became " one of the crew . " <p> I found a crew by pumping iron with two older Puerto Ricans . After we 'd worked out together a couple of times , Roberto , who was doing twenty-five years for murder , took me under his wing and showed me the ropes . He told me that it was important to always have a weapon handy in case something went down . I said I was n't looking for trouble . " It does n't matter , " he said . " Trouble has a way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later that day , we were hanging out in my cell when Roberto opened his green army jacket . From the inside pocket he removed a shank -- a six-inch sharpened piece of metal with the end wrapped in black electrical tape . He offered it to me . <p> " No , Roberto , I do n't want that . " <p> " Do n't be stupid , Tony . You got ta have something . " He looked at my locker and reached for a small box full of batteries . He snatched my laundry bag and pulled out a sweat sock . " Perfect , " he said , loading the sock with a handful of batteries and knotting the end . It became an instant blackjack . " You can use socks for a lot of different things , " he said , " from brewing coffee to smashing someone 's skull . " He placed a boot on my bed and demonstrated , raising the lethal sock over his shoulder and smashing it down on the boot . " One good crack and that motherfucker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many heads like this , and cracked many nuts , too , " he laughed . <p> " Nuts ? " <p> " Not the kind you eat . The kind you get when you 're backed up . " <p> " Backed up ? " His explanations were starting to confuse me . <p> " Yeah , backed up because you got no pussy . " He reached for the jar of Vaseline in my locker . Instinctively my fists clenched and I looked around for a guard . Roberto grabbed another sock from my bag and filled the inside with a scoop of Vaseline . " Here , " he said , handing me the sock . " When you get lonely , all you got to do is stick your dick inside and you 'll be all right . " <p> I looked at the sock and tried to imagine fucking it . " I do n't think so , " I said shaking my head in disbelief . <p> " Look , " he said angrily . " You 'll do a lot of things you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a decade and have fifteen more to go ! " He was yelling now ; the veins in his neck bulged . " I did shit even I could n't believe but I had to in order to survive . Doing time will change you -- face it . " He calmed down when he saw the look on my face . He could tell his sermon rattled me . " Just keep an open mind , Tony . It 's the only way to beat all this time you got ta do . " <p> I 'd never thought about time and its consequences . In the street , " time " was a relative concept , flowing in and out like the tide . Sometimes you had more , sometimes less . Here , it controlled you , grabbed you by the throat and made you hyperaware of your existence . Roberto spent many hours educating me about doing time . His lessons probably saved my life . <p> One day , he asked me if I 'd do his laundry for him . " Sure ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He waved a finger in my face . " You never do nobody 's laundry . " Doing someone 's laundry was the first step toward becoming his punk , he said . <p> I remained on good terms with Roberto and his Latino crew but , despite having a crew , danger still existed . Much of the danger was brought on by drugs . Sing Sing was awash in them . And where there are drugs , there 's violence . Different crews would fight each other over distribution turf . I tried to keep a low profile but learned that what Roberto had said was true : trouble has a way of finding you in prison , whether you 're looking for it or not . To survive in this environment I had to become comfortable with violence . I was n't a violent person on the outside , but I learned that violence was deeply imbedded in the prison culture , where the strong preyed on the weak . Either you defended yourself or you were victimized , plain and simple . It could start innocently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young blond-headed guy complimented me on my sunglasses . I made the mistake of letting him try them on . A week later I was walking through the block when I ran into the same guy . He was leaning against the steam pipes with two other prisoners . <p> Casually , he walked over and stepped in front of me , blocking my path . He took a broken , rusty razor blade out of his pocket and waved it in front of my face . " I want those sunglasses , motherfucker , " he said . Because I 'd let him try on my sunglasses , he figured I was easy prey and now he was testing me . <p> My friend Roberto had taught me to look at the size of the weapon before reacting . As a rule of thumb , if the weapon was n't deadly , you should fight back at all costs . If you did n't , word spread that you were a coward , which meant that your ass would be on the line with others . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run but always return with an equal-sized weapon . <p> I looked at the razor blade . It was less than an inch long . It could n't kill me , I figured . I made my choice and looked square into the guy 's face . I was ready to fight because I knew that my survival at Sing Sing depended on it . If I let him take my glasses , I 'd be pegged a pussy . The predators would find out and make my life more hellish than it already was . " Use that , " I growled , " and I 'll kill you . " I stared him down with pure hatred in my eyes , thinking about how I 'd fucked up my entire life , lost my family , and now I 'd be spending my best fifteen years in this rat hole . The piece-of-crap con must have seen the fire in my eyes and everything that was behind it . He quickly put away the blade and tried to make a joke out of it . I walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn that I could get out of most situations simply by feigning toughness , or " fronting , " as prisoners say , putting on a certain face or using certain words and speaking with absolute conviction . There were times , however , when violence was unavoidable . Often it boiled down to being in the wrong place at the wrong time . <p> One day I was walking the flats , the ground-level area of the block , when I saw this guy Nicky whom I knew from the weight room . At 6 ' 2 ? and 240 pounds of solid muscle , Nicky was a monster . The week before , he 'd noticed my sneakers and asked me what size they were . " Ten , " I said . Funny , he wore the same size , too . Since I 'd once seen Nicky whack a guy over the head with a forty-pound dumbbell just for looking at him the wrong way , I figured it 'd be a good idea to get on his good side . I told him I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair . He 'd nodded and thanked me . <p> The next day , Nicky spotted me at the rear of the cellblock and motioned me over to him . As I got closer I noticed that his face wore a strange expression and his eyes were bloodshot . From his breath I could tell he was drunk on jailhouse wine . " Give me your sneakers , " he demanded . <p> " I did n't get my new ones yet , " I said . <p> " You think I give a shift ? " Before I could answer , he unleashed a powerful upper cut that caught me square under my chin . I sailed backwards to the floor -- and my sneakers came off ! He hit me so hard I literally flew out of my sneakers . To this day , I do n't know whether they 'd been untied and flew off from the impact or if he 'd knocked me unconscious long enough to yank them off my feet . Whatever the case , shortly after hitting the floor , I popped back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to forget about it . No one wanted to start trouble with a guy like Nicky . Besides , people said he went crazy every so often , usually when he was high or drunk . If I left it alone , Nicky would be fine with me , they said . It was good prison politics . <p> Sure enough , the advice was sound . The next day in the weight room Nicky acted like nothing had happened . " Hey Tony , what 's going on ? " he said , slapping me on the back and flashing a smile . " Thanks for the sneakers , " he said . I noticed that he was wearing them . <p> " Hey , all right , " I replied . " They fit okay ? " <p> " Sure do , man , thanks again . " <p> It was good to have guys like Nicky on your side . <p> About six months into my stay I tried to get a job as an electrician in the prison . Getting assigned to certain jobs could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facility needed . And this would get me transferred to A Block , the main housing area . After that , I would n't have to worry about being shipped out to a possibly worse facility elsewhere in the state . <p> I went to the chapel where the administration had set up a committee to assign qualified prisoners to work assignments . I approached a counselor and said I 'd like to work as an electrician . I said I had skills to offer Sing Sing and that I wanted to spend my time doing something constructive , something that could get me a job in the real world once I got out . <p> " Look everyone , " the counselor called out . " This man wants to be rehabilitated ! " He doubled over in laughter . <p> I looked at his pudgy face , red with glee , and I thought of everything I 'd gone through to get to this sorry place , how I was standing there like a fool , begging for a job that paid pennies . This time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what about it ? " I shot back , not bothering to disguise the hostility in my voice . " I know lots of guys in here who want to improve themselves . " A few heads turned . The room grew quiet . <p> " Rehabilitation does not exist , " the counselor said flatly , glowering at me . <p> " Really , " I continued . " You mean to tell me that your job amounts to nothing more than locking people up ? You do n't believe in giving prisoners a chance to do something constructive with their time ?

@@4001041 ONE OF THE MOST PROMINENT causal factors of the seemingly rebounding addiction to supernaturalism as an explanation of the world and justification for action is surely the dramatic rate of social and technological change , which often forces people to abandon tradition in order to adapt to entirely new situations . In our grandparents ' day -- or even our parents ' -- what we learned in school was reasonably expected to provide us with useful information for a lifetime . No more . It has been said that information is doubling every five years . With such an exponential curve , how can anyone expect to learn it all and cope with its ramifications ? <p> This incredible rate of change quite naturally drives many people to cling to traditional approaches as they struggle to slow the process to a more comfortable pace . As a result , fundamentalism often becomes the order of the day . Not merely Islamic fundamentalism or Jewish or Christian fundamentalism but , rather , the basic fundamentalism of " I have the answers . Do n't bother me with more questions " -- a fundamentalism of " stay the course " rigidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and new data become available . <p> Fundamentalism , in turn , leads to a need for an authority figure -- be it a political leader , a teacher , a parent , or a cleric -- to interpret life 's mysteries and to give direction . As a result , people become even more dependent on powers outside of themselves instead of learning the processes and skills necessary for critical thinking and problem solving . <p> New York Times columnist Tom Friedman , quoting an Iranian woman , tells a story about the education of young boys in Middle Eastern countries . The boys are taught by clerics completely through indoctrination . They are fed information to remember but are n't allowed to think about it . No discussion , no involvement , no interaction is tolerated . Later , if they go on to university study abroad and are suddenly expected to think and offer their own ideas , they are completely at a loss . Frustrated and confused , they may seek refuge in an even deeper fundamentalism . <p> So behind the turmoil in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fundamentalism rather than thoughtfulness , and as a result , the conflict of ideologies . TRADITIONAL VERSUS HUMANISTIC RESPONSES <p> To keep apace with social and technological changes , we must obviously abandon many of our traditions . But the resultant dilemma is : replace them with what ? Do we substitute our traditions with adherence to a different set of principles , do we retreat to the safety of fundamentalism , or do we seek new responses more appropriate to the process of change ? We all admit that knowledge learned in school is merely the beginning , the stepping stones . Education evolves over the entire course of life through experience . And the degree and depth of the knowledge attained is directly related to the development and application of the skills of learning . <p> Unfortunately , too often we both teach our children and use the same processes that have been practiced for centuries , essentially transmitting the technical and cultural wisdom of the past -- known information . We have indeed updated the content : we now teach about computers and debate whether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most part , we utilize modern equipment , provide extensive financial support for schools , and employ technically competent and generally caring teachers . But we are still locked into the conservative approach of teaching already known information . <p> In the United States the political move toward conservatism in recent years has resulted in less separation between church and state and the growth of fundamentalism and rigidity . George W. Bush 's " No Child Left Behind " legislation is a classic example . While certainly well intended , it essentially promotes rote teaching and learning and emphasizes the accumulation of facts and the simple transmission of already known information by rewarding schools whose students score well on tests that measure accumulated information and punishing those whose students do n't . The importance of learning the facts is n't to be denied , but it 's a long way from the whole story . <p> There is , however , an appropriate humanistic alternative . Rather than merely teaching the what of learning , we can also teach the how . We can emphasize , much more than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach children not only to be learned but learners . And the processes of learning are eminently teachable and learnable . <p> Picture the entire concept of learning and teaching as a spectrum : on one end we have the traditional style of learning the content ; on the other end the emphasis is on learning the processes of learning -- learning how to learn . This table illustrates the idea . <p> This spectrum or dichotomy is obviously artificial and heuristic ; there is no such thing as learning the processes of learning free of content , nor of learning the content without some kind of use of the processes . But nevertheless , schools , teachers , parents , and learners have many options for the position they choose on the spectrum . And there are obvious reasons why the emphasis on learning to learn should be increased . The incredible rate of ongoing social and technological change means that no longer can an individual function by relying only on the information disseminated in school . Suppose a physician used only the knowledge gained in medical school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But even more important , a society of competent learners would be less inclined to be duped by charlatans or corrupt leaders , less susceptible to the claims of the supernatural , less inclined to be fundamentalist . A society of learners would be more able -- and likely -- to think independently from each other , to apply reason and skepticism . THE TEACHING-LEARNING PATTERN <p> In my own teaching , I employ the easy-to-remember acronym EAT . The letters stand for experience , analysis , and theory . In the traditional model -- " I know . You do n't . I 'm going to tell you . " -- the pattern begins with the T or theory . In college teaching , the theory is almost always presented in a lecture . An elementary school teacher might start by presenting a vocabulary list . Next , the big idea , or theory , is A -- analyzed . The instructor explains what the big idea means , what its components are . Then comes E -- the experience or application . This might consist of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nursing . Sometimes it is a further presentation by the teacher , explaining the application . <p> With experiential education , or in the learning-to-learn mode , the order is reversed . The parent or teacher or professor starts with an experience , or a discussion of a prior experience , and then asks the learner to analyze the experience : " What are the parts of it ? How does this connect with things you have done before or know about from another source ? What do you think about this ? How did doing this make you feel ? " The third step is the most difficult and the most neglected : the development of a theory or generalization . It 's an attempt to have the student generalize from the experience and the analysis of it . " What does it all mean ? How would you describe the whole thing ? What principles can you figure out from all of it ? What will you know the next time you work with this issue ? " <p> I teach a Master of Business Administration program course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the personal-interpersonal aspects of the working world , including such themes as leadership , motivation , interpersonal communication , supervision , and teamwork . With respect to teamwork , the traditional transfer teaching approach would have students read the chapter in the text about teamwork , view and discuss a film about teamwork , listen to a lecture about teamwork , with an emphasis on recent research , and write a paper about teamwork , perhaps emphasizing the applications of teamwork in the student 's own work setting . The sequence is T-A-E . <p> I reverse this and use an inductive , process approach . I start with an exercise in which groups of five students are asked to complete a puzzle using puzzle pieces I supply . The sets of pieces are arranged such that teamwork among the five is required . Student observers are asked to watch each group carefully , noting particularly how the group members work together and their behaviors that contribute to assembling the puzzles . Issues that are crucial to teamwork -- such as leadership , communication , sharing , possessiveness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they work . After all the groups complete their puzzles , each observer provides feedback to the team members , and a vigorous discussion follows , analyzing the puzzle experience in detail . The puzzle experience , followed by analysis , is then taken one step further . Each student is led to ask : " What is my own theory of teamwork ? How can I apply my theory when I go to work tomorrow morning ? How can I be a better team member or leader ? " <p> My role as a teacher has become less the role of " expert " and instead the more difficult one of " facilitator " : I plan the experience , encourage the thorough analysis of it , and share the skills so that students can come to their own legitimate conclusions . The teacher as expert provides the facts and knowledge whereas the facilitative teacher provides or reviews an experience and helps the student analyze it and build a theory . This latter approach leads to deeper understanding and wisdom . And as you might expect , the exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion , and leads to personal growth for everyone involved . <p> The most successful faculty development workshop I ever conducted was on the EAT model . I distributed copies of the several-sentence course descriptions from our college catalog to the participants but made sure they did n't get one from their own discipline . A nursing instructor , a math professor , and a history professor each got a social psychology course description . A physics teacher , a marketing professor , and a music teacher each got one about anthropology . Then they met in small groups and were instructed to plan the course . Outside the realm of their expertise , the workshop forced them to utilize their facilitative skills in order to ground the course in student experiences . After a bit of good-natured grumbling , these people worked hard to plan an interesting and exciting course that would utilize experiences like simulations and role play , case studies , field trips , instruments , and assignments such as student research projects . They would conclude by helping students analyze the experiences and generate theoretical constructs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , more ideas surfaced . By the end of the exercise some of the participants said they wanted to take a course presented that way rather than totally by experts . And several made the point that the student learning that would have been engendered by such a course would transcend the course content itself and result in the development of learning skills applicable in other settings and for other content . TIPS FOR TEACHERS AND PARENTS <p> Here are a few ideas for teachers and parents interested in the process learning model . ( You will undoubtedly be able to think of more ideas and plan activities specifically suited to the learner in your life , including yourself . ) <p> * When your child comes home from school , you should certainly ask , as you hopefully do now , " What did you learn in school today ? " But you can develop it further by asking " How did you learn that ? " While an initial response may be " The teacher told us , " with careful attention he or she can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own learning processes . <p> * Do n't forget about the emotional aspects of learning . Because of their focus on reason , Humanists are often mistakenly thought of as unemotional . But emotions are an important aspect of learning . When your child is happy about learning something at school , be sure to reinforce that feeling . When your child tells you about a school experience , ask for details and express your feelings . For example , in discussing a book read in class , ask how the protagonists must have felt in the situation your child describes . Share your own feelings with your child or memories of similar experiences in your life . <p> * Help your child learn to figure things out . Do n't be too quick with the easy answer , too quick to be an expert . Good teachers are worth their weight in gold ; experts are a dime a dozen . Problem solving is a learnable set of steps using logic , rationalism , organizational skills , and decision-making patterns . Help your child think through these processes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick answer can quash curiosity . While we should n't deliberately withhold information , a measured response can help a child to think critically and develop an answer on his or her own . <p> * Children gain self-esteem by learning and sharing knowledge . Being able to contribute as part of a team rather than as a mere recipient of information builds a child 's sense of self-worth . <p> * Many become excessively dependent on a psychoanalyst , a cleric , a political leader , a parent , or a physician to provide them with their beliefs . Fundamentalism is n't limited the fringes of some religions . The importance of an authority figure to many people is growing , not diminishing as we might hope as time goes on and society matures . We all need to be careful to avoid creating powerful dependency needs in our children . Ask yourself if it 's more important that your children be just like you or that they each be independent , self-reliant individuals , even if it means you might disagree on some issues . Process learning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of self-reliance . The most functional parents guide their children to independence . Be a guide on the side , not a sage on a stage . <p> * As a parent , you can help your children enormously to become self-learners by supporting their skills in making choices . Learning the processes of making choices -- weighing the alternatives , remembering earlier experiences , seeing what others have done in similar situations -- can be of enormous help to them , especially as they face issues like the temptations of drug use , choice of friends , career goals , and the like . How your children make these choices is a learning to learn issue and one that most of us neglect in our own lives . Careful decision making can mean the difference between success and failure in many of life 's arenas . If we believe we can determine our own future , that our activities determine the quality of our lives , then it behooves us to plan those activities carefully . <p> As Humanists , we need to respond to a dramatically changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We need to respond to the rigidity of fundamentalism with more openness and flexibility . The concept of process learning , or learning-to-learn -- as distinct from learning by the transmission of already known information -- is a vital step in the right direction .

@@4001341 A computerized block design task was developed which records temporal and nontemporal measures of performance . This study evaluates the reliability of the measures and reports their intercorrelations . With one exception , the measures showed moderate to good reliability . The results indicate that increasing the difficulyv of the task and testing a more diverse sample may be necessary for improved reliability . A nontemporal method of scoring a block-design task would be useful when testing persons who have handicaps affecting motor skills . but no central nervous system deficits . <p> Previous research has demonstrated that college undergraduates have little difficulty adapting to a computerized block design task . Temporal performance on the computerized task has a reliability coefficient similar to the Block Design subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-Revised ( WAIS-R ) , and is moderately correlated with temporal performance on that subtest ( Martin &; Wilcox , 1989 ; Wechsler , 1981 ) . <p> Tasks of this type assess analysis of visual patterns , visual-spatial manipulation , and synthesis of visual patterns . However , they are also affected by psychomotor speed ( Cohen , Montague , Nathanson , &; Swerdlik , 1988 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorically slow , yet retain good visual-spatial skills . In large part , this bias is attributable to the importance of temporal measures in conventional scoring methods . <p> In the interest of developing a method of scoring a block-design task that is unaffected by psychomotor speed , the present study investigates a nontemporal approach to measuring block design performance . The study examines the reliability of three nontemporal measures , and explores the relationship of temporal and nontemporal measures of performance on the computerized block design task . METHOD <p> Subjects <p> Subjects were 53 undergraduates attending a small comprehensive university who volunteered to take part in the study to receive extra credit in their introductory course in psychology . Of 53 subjects , 43 were female and 10 were male . Another five subjects were tested , but excluded from the data analysis because their knuckles inadvertently hit the " finished " button , prematurely ending a trial . <p> Apparatus <p> Software to control stimulus presentation and data collection was written in HyperTalk , the scripting language of the HyperCard environment ( Apple Computer , 1988 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer equipped with one megabyte of RAM , two internal 800K floppy disk drives , a CMS SD43 external hard drive , and a Mac'n Touch touch screen from MicroTouch Systems . <p> The software creates screen displays of the type shown in Figure 1 . The upper left part of the screen is occupied by a stimulus design , and the upper right portion of the screen contains a response area . In the lower center of the screen is a single block which may be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise by touching the adjacent curved arrows . Touching the small white block at the bottom of the screen makes the larger block white , touching the black one changes it to black , and touching the small white and black block has the effect of changing the pattern of the larger block to black and white . <p> A copy of the stimulus design can be constructed by choosing the block pattern and rotation one wishes to place in the duplicate design , touching one of the nine gray boxes in the response area to copy the single block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process until all nine blocks are in place . Errors may be corrected by choosing another block and copying it into the same section of the duplicate design . <p> Procedure <p> Subjects were seated in front of the computer , and instructed in the use of the touch screen to choose and rotate the block on the screen . Subjects then practiced manipulating the block . They were next shown a nine-block practice design . The experimenter demonstrated the use of the touch screen to copy the design , cleared the response area , and allowed subjects to practice building the design . When they finished the practice design , the testing session began . <p> Each testing session consisted of 10 designs of varying difficulty which were presented in random order . Subjects had unlimited time to complete each design ; they indicated they had completed a design by touching the button on the screen labeled " finished . " The computer stored data reflecting the accuracy of the design they constructed , the time taken to complete it , screen touches within the response area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designs had been completed , the subject was debriefed . After the subject left the laboratory ? the data were printed and stored on disk . RESULTS <p> The measures of performance used in this study were response time , manipulations , moves , and correct completions . Response time represents the mean number of seconds that elapsed from the time a stimulus pattern was first displayed until subjects touched the " finished " button . The term manipulations refers to the number of screen touches per trial outside the constructed design ; moves are screen touches per trial within the constructed design . Correct completions are the number of designs accurately reproduced per subject . Descriptive data for each are displayed in Table 1 . Coeffecient alpha was calculated as an estimate of internal consistency for each measure ; the results are also displayed in Table 1 . The correlation matrix in Table 2 portrays the relationship of the variables to one another . DISCUSSION <p> Measures of block design performance , except correct completions , show moderate to good reliability . However , the pattern of results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is restricted by ceiling or floor effects . Since nine moves are required to complete each design , the mean of 11.88 indicates that subjects on average made fewer than three errors of placement per design . The correct completion rate of 98.5% also represents a substantial ceiling effect . This suggests that reliability of the nontemporal measures could be increased if the difficulty of the task was raised to the point at which subjects made more errors when building designs , and failed to accurately reproduce some designs . <p> Increased reliability might conceivably be achieved by increasing the number of blocks per design , increasing the complexity of stimulus patterns , or requiring subjects to construct a rotation or mirror image of the stimulus design . One may also assume a sample of college undergraduates represents a notable restriction of range by comparison to the standardization sample of a test such as the WAIS-R ; testing a more diverse sample would undoubtedly bolster the reliability of the weaker measures . <p> If the reliability of nontemporal measures of performance on this block design task can be augmented and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures of visual-spatial skills for persons whose motor skills are impaired by pathology of the peripheral nervous system or other handicapping conditions , but have no central deficits . In addition , the consistency and ease of administration inherent in computerized tests suggest that this task may have utility for the general population as well . <p> 
@@4001441 Our purpose in this study is to view theories of psychotherapy from a general social-political context , especially insofar as they pertain to values . Beginning with Weisskopf-Joelson 's ( 1980 ) thesis that theories of psychotherapy may be " perceptual houses " with their own unique value structures , we studied the values of psychoanalytic psychotherapists within the framework of Rokeach 's ( 1968 ) system . Through the Rokeach Value Survey , we examined the values held by a group of psychoanalytic trainees in 1979 and those held by a group of practicing psychoanalysts in 1993 . Because neither group of subjects can be regarded as randomly representative of the universe of psychoanalysts , we regard the resultant data as evocative and informative rather than definitive . Nonetheless , we examined the extent to which value profiles for the psychoanalytic trainees of 1979 were similar or dissimilar to those of practicing psychoanalysts in 1993 . Such comparisons at the least provide some general indication as to whether valu es have shifted in the universe within this time period . Findings are presented about specific patterns of values , and implications are discussed . There appears to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we studied , lending support to this discipline 's designation of a " perceptual house " insofar as its values are concerned . <p> Values seem to evoke much discussion and controversy . In the public domain , " family " values , " religious " values , " good " values , or " bad " values are discussed as if their criteria are self-evident . In addition , values have generated interest in such areas as " moral " and " value " education and " values clarification . " This pervasiveness attests to the importance of the notion as well as to its lack of clarity . People have values . Institutions have values . Societies have values . These seem to be accepted truths , although they remain vague and general . Not surprisingly , the field of psychotherapy has not been immune from the wide ranging , yet imprecise , presence of the elusive construct of values . <p> Schwartz ( 1990 ) examined the ways in which values are embodied in social institutions and the ways in which social institutions influence the values of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embodies individual values when , in the normal course of its operation , the institution offers people roles that encourage behavior expressing those values and fosters conditions for their further expression ... The values that an individual can express are very much constrained by the character of the social institutions and the social order in which that individual lives ( p. 8 ) . <p> Rokeach ( 1979 ) , in addressing this issue , defined institutional values as " socially shared cognitive representations of institutional goals and demands " ( p.50 ) and suggested that " the most distinctive property or defining characteristic of a social institution is its values " ( p.51 ) . <p> Scientific psychology has consistently kept the question of values out of its system , in its attempt to stress the scientifically objective component of its field ( Harari , 1989 ; Freud , 1934 ) . In this context , it is interesting to find that some authors see psychotherapy as sharing the interactional arena with the arts , in that they both feature the constant interchange between values and technique ( Gorelick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged and dismissed the issue of values in psycho therapy . As a scientific endeavor , he asserted , psychoanalysis did not require or possess a value system distinct from the values of science , which it embraced . This traditional position on values remained the prevalent stance in psychoanalysis ( Harari , 1989 ) even though it was understood that people could not maintain this ideal objective stance . It would appear that , although values were recognized as inevitable , the ideal remained of a possible value-free endeavor , and deviation there-from were seen as problems of the therapist or labeled as " countertransference . " Indeed , values have often been noted in psychotherapy in a negative context -- i.e. , as a problem when therapy is not proceeding according to the " script . " Myriads of case presentations point to values as the culprit in the derailing of the psychotherapeutic paradigm , as exemplified by Cabaniss , Oquendo , and Singer 's ( 1994 ) exploration of the effect of psychoanalytic culture ( i.e. , the analyst-patient ) and its values on the **32;1554;TOOLONG process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that values are often discussed in the current literature , even in settings which are quite removed from psychotherapy ( Sankowski , 1989 ) . <p> In a circumscribed context , however , values were reckoned with in a positive perspective . Hartman ( 1960 ) conceptualized one prevalent view by positing that the only values that are relevant in psychotherapy are so called " health values , " or those very directly related to the work at hand . These " health values " have generated definitions ranging from Freud 's ( 1989/1934 ) truth and reality , to the sufficient conditions for the nurturing of the ego ( Hartmann , 1960 ) , the facilitating environment of Object Relations theory ( Winnicott , 1965 ) , the definition of the self ( Kohut , 1977 ) , awareness and integration in a Gestalt perspective ( Perls et al. , 1951 ) , and Rogers ' ( 1961 ) basic therapeutic conditions , to present a representative sample . This rich diversity of definitions seems to restrict the concept of values within the parameters of the particular concepts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that values are not usually highlighted in orthodox analyses of the psychotherapeutic process . Instead , they are often featured in fields which represent the intersections of psychotherapy and allied disciplines . The contemporary psychosomatic approach incorporates values into its presuppositions ( Sanders , 1988 ) . The hermeneutic method of analyzing psychotherapy , for example , refers to " guiding values " of the conversation which effects change ( Barnes , 1993 ) . The adherents of Logotherapy blatantly present their approach as a system of values similar to those of a secular religion ( Kreitmer , 1992 ) . Related to the latter characterization , is the assumption in existential psychology that one 's attitude toward authenticity is influenced by the therapist 's personal values ( Rubinstein , 1994 ) . <p> Moreover , values are intrinsic to some of the more recent areas where psychology and social issues have been synthesized . Constructivism , for example , sees values as playing a central role in clinical practice ( Dean , 1993 ) . Kelly 's Personal Construct Psychology , in particular , sees an integral relationship between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its theory ( Walker , 1992 ) . Other authors actually typify feminist-oriented psychotherapy by positing a distinct value profile for the approach ( Lakin , 1991 ) . Postmodern authors on psychotherapy uniformly highlight the salience of the practitioner 's values ( Chapman , 1993 ) . <p> An index of values ' emerging prominence in the field is the recent straightforward call by the Society for the Exploration of Psychotherapy Integration , calling for the definition of psychotherapy integration while highlighting values as a cardinal factor in therapy ( Beitman , 1994 ) . It is noteworthy that the directionality of influence between psychotherapy and values also runs in the reverse . Thus , criteria have been offered for therapists to determine whether their clients ' religiosity is particularly healthy or unhealthy ( Bergin , 1991 ) , which seems to portend an attempt at objectively qualifying the legitimacy ( rather than functionality ) of values in the counseling interaction . In categorizing values by the phenomena which precipitate and give rise to the values , some authors have been led to actually categorize values as rational vs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that values are , by definition , not based on logic , making the rational evaluation of values an oxymoron at best <p> It can be argued that all of the contemporary therapies are oriented at the tension between individual and societal values . Specifically , individual values will often entail goals which encroach on others ' needs , while societal values often usurp individual needs for the good of the larger group . The therapies can be seen as attempting to balance intrinsic values against the backdrop of a field-wide mor of commitment to human freedom without dogmatism , in a mode which will respect human autonomy . In a detailed analysis of therapy approaches , Richardson ( 1989 ) shows how Freud , Jung , Fromm , and Rational Emotive approaches all employ similar strategies in dealing with this freedom-commitment dilemma , although each stresses different aspects as primary . Since each conceptual orientation presents a somewhat different emphasis in value orientation , it would appear that Weisskopf-Joelson ( 1980 ) is correct when she sees the pervasiveness of different values in various schools of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceptual houses " to which clients are converted . Weiskopf-Joelson refers to each school of psychotherapy as a " perceptual house " since each perspective brings with it a distinct set of preconceptions and apperceptions which structure reality according to its a priori postulates and beliefs . These " houses " include value systems which , though rarely explicit , are nonetheless normative in that setting and are seen as desirable goals of any therapeutic intervention . If they are " perceptual houses , " then they are not merely a collection of individuals but have more the qualities and characteristics of an institution . <p> It follows , then , that as a prototype of an institution , each therapeutic community should feature a shared value system . Indeed , studies pursuing this thesis have been done in evaluating cross-cultural applications of counseling . For example , a particular analysis of Japanese-based psychotherapies analyzed differential approaches , concluding that goals are central to all approaches and that there is evidence of universal values in defining the fully functioning self . The researchers conceptualized cultural differences in the divergence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relationship of individual vs. interpersonal values within each culture ( Noon and Lewis , 1992 ) . This approach has , in fact , resulted in some authors conceptualizing the psychotherapeutic process as " healing by culture " ( Havenaar , 1990 ) . <p> The exploration of societal values has been stressed as beneficial for discrete subpopulations . Some stress it as crucial for the therapeutic process in dealing specifically with adolescents ( Ponton , 1993 ) . Other foci seem to limit the salience of values only to specific contextual environments . As an example of the salience of values by treatment context , consider the conflict of the college based therapist , whose very work is embedded in an institution whose values have little relation to psychology . In such instances , it would be disruptive , both to the therapy process and to the client , to proceed without a keen awareness of the values of the host institution ( May , 1991 ) . <p> It is not surprising that the confluence of religion and psychotherapy is marked by pointed attention to personal values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in espousing the centrality of values . Detailed prerequisites are offered for the counselor entering the field , and research data are offered that a client who has knowledge about the counselor 's values and goals prior to psychotherapy is more able to make informed choices ( Lewis and Epperson , 1991 ) . The non-sectarian Pastoral Counseling actually defines its uniqueness in the assumed similarity of values between therapist and client ( Peterson , 1990 ) . Moreover , some authors interpret the psychotherapeutic process in Pastoral Counseling as a moral enterprise ( Erickson , 1989 ) . <p> Clearly , this approach need not be limited to the specific cultural , age-limited , or contextual therapies at all . It is posited that any therapeutic approach embodies its own unique value structure . The purpose of this investigation was to explore that value system of therapists adhering to a particular theoretical orientation . <p> Since the issue under investigation is whether theoretical orientations in their institutional manifestation become " perceptual houses " which might have a shared value system , it was imperative that the values not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general field of " mental health .

A search of Dissertation Abstracts Ondisc shows forty-nine citations for the instrument from 1975 to 1982 , eighty citations from 1983 to 1988 , forty-four citations from 1989 to 1993 , and thirty citations from 1994 through September of 1997 . A search of Psychlit shows 243 journal article citations from 1974 to 1990 and fifty-four journal article citations from 1991 through September of 1997 . A search of ERIC shows forty-one educational citations from 1982 to 1991 and thirteen educational citations from 1992 to June of 1997 . <p> Rokeach ( 1979 ) conceptualized human value systems as consisting of a relatively small number of core ideas or cognitions present in every society . The following definitions of " value " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that a person has a value is to say that he has an enduring prescriptive or proscriptive belief that a specific mode of behavior or end-state of existence is preferred to an opposite mode of behavior or end-state . This belief transcends attitudes toward objects and toward situations ; it is a standard that guides and determines action , attitudes toward objects and situations , ideology , presentations of self to others , evaluations , judgments , justifications , comparisons of self with others , and attempts to influence others ( Rokeach , 1973 , p.25 ) . <p> In terms of context , Rokeach ( 1968 ) suggested that values exist in hierarchies or priorities which involve the selection and organization of values into systems . In other words , values are not static and do not stand alone , but in relationship to each other . It is the system and the relationship of values to each other for a person at a particular time that are the most meaningful representations of the system . <p> These ideas can be organized into at least two systems representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as desirable end states of existence . Simply put , these values are , in fact , goals . Instrumental Values , defined in the literature as desirable modes of behavior instrumental to the attainment of these end states . Simply put , these values are means to an end . <p> In his approach to the subject , Rokeach studied the value structure of institutions and was emphatic that the values of members of the institution ( gatekeepers ) are among the most sensitive indicators of the values of an institution , since these values serve the dual functions of both reflecting and reinforcing the values within a particular social institution . THE STUDIES <p> This paper reports findings of two studies of the values of **27;1588;TOOLONG psychotherapists which were conducted approximately fourteen years apart . Data collection for the first study was begun in 1978 and completed in 1979 , while those for the second study were begun in 1992 and completed in 1993 . Both studies used the Rokeach Values Survey ( RVS ) at a prominent New York City psychoanalytic training program . It was assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reflected in some of the values shifts , but that some of the consistency , if any , might be attributed to a shared professional identity and socialization . Procedures <p> One theoretical orientation , psychoanalysis , was selected for examination to determine whether a group that shares a theoretical orientation also shares a value orientation . This theoretical orientation appears to fit Weisskopf-Joelson 's ( 1980 ) definition of a " perceptual house . " In 1978 and again in 1992 , the administration of a well-known training program in psychoanalysis and psychotherapy consented to facilitate data collection within their program . In 1978 , the first author participated in a weekend retreat , giving a short talk on values research and then presented a general overview of this study . At the conclusion of the presentation , he asked the members to volunteer to participate in the study . Their anonymity was guaranteed . Research packets , which included a short demographic questionnaire and a copy of the RVS , were left on a conveniently located table . There was also a drop-off box for the completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author . <p> In 1992 , individual packets were mailed to all members of the same training program . These packets contained a cover letter describing the study which guaranteed anonymity and requested voluntary participation . Enclosed was a demographic questionnaire , the RVS , and a pre-paid return envelope . ( The data for the second study only became available recently , as they were held up for years by bureaucratic issues beyond the authors ' control . ) Participants <p> The participants in these studies were all members of a **27;1617;TOOLONG psychotherapeutic training program . These were primarily post-doctoral level psychologists who went on for further training . For the first study , fifty-nine of the eighty-nine ( 66% ) program participants took packets ; all were returned . Respondents included twenty-seven males , twenty-eight females , and four whose gender were not identified . ( Racial data were not solicited in the first study . However , by recollection there were only two Black and three Latino program participants among an otherwise all White population . ) For the second study , there were a total of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 407 women . There were 179 usable questionnaires and values surveys returned ( Return rate = 25.7% ) . The results from the demographic questionnaire for the second group revealed the following profile of the sample : sixty-six ( 36.9% ) were male and 113 ( 63.1% ) were female ; participant age ranged from thirty-nine to seventy-nine years old ; 159 ( 88.9% ) stated that they were White , three ( 1.7% ) identified themselves as Black , one ( .6% ) as Asian , and sixteen ( 8.9% ) did not respond to the item . The participants reported twenty-eight different ethnic descriptions . The predominant one , reported by 115 ( 64.2% ) , was Jewish , and twenty-two ( 12.3% ) did not re-Katz , Juni , and Matz 345 spend to the item . Of the remaining , the range varied from WASP to Italian-American , to West Indian , to Irish American , to such descriptions as Catholic-Swiss-Italian , American-Mongrel , **27;1646;TOOLONG , and Chinese-English , to cite a selected sample . Instrument <p> The Rokeach Value Survey ( RVS ) consists of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idealized end-states of existence ; and 18 Instrumental values , or desirable codes of behavior ( Rokeach , 1968 ) . The RVS has been shown to differentiate among a variety of populations on various dimensions which include religion , occupation , social class , ethnicity , culture , political orientation , etc. , to cite a selected sample ( Beech , 1970 ; Feather , 1986 ; Katz &; Beech , 1978 , 1980 ; Katz , Juni , Shope , &; Tang , 1993 ; Rokeach , 1968 , 1973 , 1979 ) . To complete the instrument , respondents are asked to rank order the values presented from most to least important to them . They are told to place a " 1 " next to the value that was most important to them , a " 2 " for the second most important value , and so on , until all eighteen values are ranked . This procedure is followed for both the Terminal and Instrumental values . RESULTS AND DISCUSSION <p> The results of this investigation will be presented to highlight the values of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To organize the data , we will present the results focusing on : The average numerical ( rank ) level of each value for the two time periods . The rank order position ( for the entire sample ) and changes therein of each value within the value system . We chose the benchmark of a rank order change of four positions to signify a meaningful shift in values between the two periods . <p> These methods offer very different kinds of information . Rokeach argued that the former provided statistical significance and the latter greater psychological significance . These are not contradictory endeavors when using an ipsative scale ( which the Rokeach Value Survey is ) , and therefore both will be reported and discussed . <p> Table 1 presents the comparison of the 1979 and 1993 rankings and means of the Terminal values using the RVS . Using the two analytic methods , there are seven Terminal values which differ significantly ( beyond the .05 level ) between the two time periods . These are , in order of descending statistical significance : Family Security ( .001 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Comfortable Life , Freedom , Inner Harmony , and Pleasure ( .05 ) . As can be seen , A Comfortable Life , Equality , and Family Security were ranked higher in 1993 than in 1979 , while Freedom , Inner Harmony , and Pleasure were ranked lower . Mature Love remains the most important value , although its mean drops much lower by 1993 . Thus , it would appear that these two populations differed on these seven values when the values are considered in isolation rather than as part of an overall value system . <p> In applying the second analytic method of meaningful rank-order change within the values system , utilizing a shift of four or more ranking positions as the criterion for meaningful change , two values meet this criterion : Family Security becomes more important ( from 8 to 3 ) while Inner Harmony decreases in importance ( from 4 to 8 ) . It is noteworthy in this context that Family Security becomes part of the top four values while Inner Harmony drops out that salient group . <p> It is remarkable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time periods were all in the salient group of values , as defined by the criterion of the upper and lower four rankings . For example , A Comfortable Life shifted from rank 16 ( the very low ) in 1979 to a 1993 ranking of 13 . Family Security , on the other hand , shifted from a ranking of 8 in 1979 to 3 in 1993 . Mature Love , by contrast , is an interesting value to acknowledge , as its mean rank shifts from 3.47 to 4.87 , yet its rank position remains the same ( 1 ) in both time periods . Of the seven values whose means were significantly different from 1979 to 1993 , four of the means were higher while three were lower . Such a complementarity in shift , however , is likely due to the ipsative nature of rank-order data which mandates that any shift in one direction be accompanied by a complementary shift in the other . <p> The two analytic methods present different , but not contradictory , findings . They do seem to reflect changes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions . Certain of the responses were statistically significant over time , but did not reflect changes in the overall value system as a whole . ( For example , the mean value of Mature Love shifted from 3.47 to 4.87 , while its rank remained 1 for both time periods . ) Other values , however , showed shifts in rank order which corresponded to the statistically significant shifts in the mean values respectively ( as exemplified by Family Security and Inner Harmony ) . Table 2 presents the comparison of the 1979-1993 rankings of the Instrumental Values . Three Values that were statistically significantly different ( Imaginative , Independent , and Responsible ) . Of the three , Responsible also reflects a meaningful change in four rank order positions ( from 7 to 3 ) . The other two ( Imaginative and Independent ) reflect shifts in only three rank order positions , falling short of our criterion for meaningful change . On the other hand , Intellectual has the distinct differential feature of showing a rank order change of four positions , but failing to reach statistical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two time periods is their shared level of consistency . Besides the above noted changes , fifteen of the eighteen mean pairs do not differ significantly , while thirteen reflect a value position change of 1 or less . <p> Another way of understanding the importance and resonance of values is to examine those that are most important and those that are least important to the respondents . The senior author , who has been using the RVS for more than 25 years , has often asked respondents about the experience of ranking the two sets of 18 values . One of the " consensual " responses was that people seem to approach the scale with greatest clarity at the extremes . They know what they value most and what they value least with greater definitiveness than those that fall more in the mid-range of the scale . This differential can be examined by highlighting these values in the context of the entire values system of the respondents . Table 3 presents the Terminal Value hierarchies from 1979 to 1993 . It includes the means for each value ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of four values respectively . <p> A review of Table 3 reveals that 3 of the 4 top values remain in the same upper cluster from 1979 to 1993 : Mature Love ( 1 to 1 ) , Self-Respect ( 2 to 2 ) , and True Friendship ( 3 to 4 ) . Inner Harmony , ranked 4 in 1979 , drops to 8 in 1993 , and is replaced by Family Security in the upper cluster . A review of the lower cluster reveals that two of the four remain in the same respective positions ( Salvation -18 and National Security -17 ) . A Comfortable Life ( 16 to 13 ) and Equality ( 15 to 12 ) drop out of the lower cluster and are replaced by Pleasure ( 13 to 16 ) and Social Recognition ( 11 to 15 ) by 1993 . <p> The other method of assessing value change , as noted earlier , is movement of at least 4 rank order positions . As can be seen in Table 3 , Family Security ( 8 to 3 ) , Inner Harmony ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 15 ) all exhibit such shifts . Parenthetically , all three involve shifts , either into or out of , the salient clusters at the two extremes of the continuum . <p> Table 4 presents the Instrumental Value hierarchies from 1979 to 1993 . It includes the means for each value and demarcates the highest and lowest group of four values respectively . As can be seen , two of the four top ranked values remain unchanged ( Loving at 1 , and Honest at 2 ) . Independent drops from 3 to 6 , while Courageous drops from 4 to 7 . These values are replaced in the top cluster by Responsible ( which rises from 7 to 3 ) and Capable ( 5 to 4 ) . All four of the lower cluster of values remain unchanged . Applying the value change criterion of four places identifies two values which shifted meaningfully -- Responsible ( which rises from 7 to 3 ) and Intellectual ( which rises from 9 to 5 ) . <p> If we reflect on the stability of the most and least resonant values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the identification of the enduring values and value system of psychoanalytic psychotherapists , based on the consistency of certain values in their relative positions across time -- in this case from 1979 to 1993 . For the Terminal values , Mature Love , Self-Respect , and True Friendship are clearly most important . Salvation and National Security are evidently least important within this values system . For the Instrumental values , Loving and Honest maintained their positions as most important values over time , while Obedient , Clean , Polite , and Self-Controlled remained in the least important group . These results represent a consistency that can not be ignored . <p> Paralleling the pattern of the value rankings in Tables 1 and 2 , these results likewise point to both stability and change in the values system of this group of psychoanalytic psychotherapists . Over a fourteen-year period , given all of the social and political changes which occurred in the interim -- in the profession , the country , and the greater world -- this Terminal value structure has maintained the primacy of Mature Love , Self-Respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dramatic environmental changes during this period , reflected in managed care private practice , the reduction in academic employment opportunities , the loss of Internship Sites -- in the professional realm , as well as the shift from a cold war status to one of U.S. hegemony , and other political cataclysmic changes with the collapse of the Soviet Empire and the change of the regime in China -- in the greater world . ) At the other end of the scale , Salvation and National Security persevere . <p> Rokeach ( 1973 ) conceptualized Terminal Values as consisting of two domains representing personal goals and social goals respectively . Personal Goals are intrapersonal and self-centered , whereas social goals are interpersonal and society-centered . The eighteen Terminal Values consist of values that reflect thirteen Personal Goals and five values that reflect Social Goals ( Kelly &; Strupp , 1992 ; Rokeach , 1973 ) . These two categories are as follows : <p> Personal Goals : A Comfortable Life , An Exciting Life , Family Security , Happiness , Inner Harmony , Mature Love , Pleasure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recognition , True Friendship , Wisdom . Kelly &; Strupp ( 1992 ) used a version of the RVS that includes the value Health and excludes the value Happiness ( We used the version that excludes Health and includes Happiness in the Personal Goals subgroup . ) <p> Social Goals : Equality , Freedom , National Security , A World of Peace , A World of Beauty . <p> A review of the results indicates that although two of the Social Goals were significantly different in their statistical mean shift ( Equality and Freedom ) , none reflected meaningful rank-order changes . In addition , Table 3 shows that the top four Terminal Values in 1979 , as well as the top four Terminal Values in 1993 , were all related to Personal Goals . Psychoanalysis appears then to embrace a value system that emphasizes personal over social goals . <p> This emphasis on personal rather than social values for psychoanalytic psychotherapists is understandable , since both theory and practice focus on the individual and their very personal struggles . The primacy of intrapsychic struggles and the centrality of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in concordance with a personal value emphasis as compared to a social value emphasis . <p> Table 5 presents the analysis of gender differences for Terminal Values between these populations of psychoanalytic psychotherapists for 1979 . Only one value , A World of Beauty , showed a statistically significant difference between men and women . In terms of rank order differences , two values , A World of Beauty ( women-12 , men-16 ) and Pleasure ( women-15 , men-11 ) , reflect meaningful differences in the value system . These results indicate a very high degree of inter-gender consistency in this group . Moreover , the directions of these differences would seem to support the " traditional " view of gender roles . <p> Table 6 presents the analysis of gender differences in Instrumental Values between these populations of psychoanalytic psychotherapists for 1979 . There were no gender differences which reached statistical significance . Only one value , Courageous , reflects a meaningful rank gender difference ( men-8 , women-3 ) . The Instrumental values system appears to show even less heterogeneity than the Terminal values system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus seem practically indistinguishable by their respective value orientations . <p> Table 7 presents the analysis of gender differences in Terminal Values between these populations of psychoanalytic psychotherapists for 1993 . Two statistically significant inter-gender differentials , Happiness ( women-7.68 , men-9.20 ) and True Friendship ( women-5.66 , men-7.79 ) appear , while True Friendship also reflects a meaningful rank differential ( women-4 , men-8 ) . Thus , in the Terminal Value system , the latter value is the only one reflecting both statistical and meaningful rank order gender difference . <p> Table 8 presents the gender comparison for the 1993 Instrumental Values . There were statistically significant differences on three values : Intellectual ( men-7.61 , women-6.42 ) , Logical ( men-11.64 , women-12.88 ) , and Polite ( men-13.98 , women-14.91 ) . Additionally , Intellectual also showed a meaningful rank order differences between genders , as it was ranked fifth by females and ninth by males . Only the difference of the value Intellectual is reflected in both methods of analysis . Once again , the dearth of differences in Instrumental Values appears to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inter-gender data on Instrumental Values across 1979 and 1993 , we note that in 1979 one value , Courageous , indicated inter-gender differentials , with females ranking it higher than males . In 1993 , three statistically significant values appeared : Intellectual , Logical , and Polite . The direction of these differentials is quite important from a **26;1704;TOOLONG perspective . Stereotypically , within the context of sex roles , Intellectual and Logical are seen as male typologies , while Polite is seen as female typed . Our data , however , indicate that women show higher values for Intellectual , while men show higher values for Polite . Only Logical shows the differential in the stereotypical direction . It is thus clear that the differential value structure among the population we researched is not at all consistent with sex role stereotypy . In view of the results appearing in the approximate time frame of the rise of feminist consciousness , one may question whether the stereotypy with regards to sex role is still empirically viable at our current state of social-political evolution . <p> One way of examining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ socially-or personally-oriented ( Braithwaite , 1994 ; Rokeach , 1973 ) . As noted in Table 3 , there are five social values and thirteen personal values as part of the Terminal Value system . The five social values are Equality , Freedom , National Security , A World at Peace , and A World of Beauty ; the remainder are personal values . Although this obviously presents a skewed distribution , it is interesting to note in Table 3 that none of the social values are in the top four positions , while two ( Equality at 15 and National Security at 17 ) are in the bottom four . Two of the other three social values are ranked fairly low ( World of Beauty -14 , A World at Peace -12 ) , while Freedom is ranked higher ( at 5 ) . <p> An additional interesting outcome of this data relates to the political orientation of the group surveyed . Two of the values , Equality and Freedom , have been demonstrated to be indicators of the political orientation of individuals and groups ( Rokeach , 1973 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are : communism , socialism , conservatism , and fascism . Political orientation is determined by examining the relative ranking of the two values ( see Figure 1 ) . When Equality is high and Freedom is low , this is reflective of communism ; Equality high and Freedom high is reflective of socialism ; Freedom high and Equality low is reflective of conservatism ; and Freedom low and Equality low is reflective of fascism . In 1979 , as can be seen in Figure 1 , Freedom was ranked relatively high ( with its rank of 5 just missing our adopted benchmark of 4 ) while Equality ranked low ( 15 ) , representing a conservative political position . In 1993 , Freedom dropped to a rank position of 7 and Equality rose to a rank position of 12 . Staying with this model , this convergence of both values ( away from the low and high ends of the hierarchy ) appears to reflect a shift from one of clarity ( conservative ) to one that seems undifferentiated . Although the relative relationship remains the same , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position ( top 4 or bottom 4 ) ; their meaning is reduced . This shift away from resonance seems to mirror movement toward a more apolitical stance in which neither of these values ( Freedom or Equality ) is very important . We are surely not in a position to say what this shift means , but speculate that it may be a reflection of the zeitgeist of the times : a politically conservative era that began in the early 1980 's and continues to flourish today . <p> Upon further reflection , the relationship between these values may well identify a problem in the original conceptualization of political orientation . This group does not seem to fit the ideology continuum of communism , socialism , conservatism , and fascism ; however , the continuum itself , perhaps , is open to question . The terms used in the media and public in general are conservative or liberal , perhaps reflecting a liberal position . According to these results , liberals would be more " middle of the roaders " than reflective of any clear ideological position . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it represents an ideological stance rather than an active social or political stance . This implies that the values do not actually correspond to actual behavior since their formulation is intrinsically abstract as such ( Braithwaite , 1994 ) . Together , these issues minimize the salience of political orientation to our contemporary sample . <p> The results of this study also point in the direction of a psychoanalytic values system . The most important Terminal values are Mature Love , Self-Respect , and True Friendship , which seem to inform people 's relationship to themselves and to others . Not just love , but rather Mature Love , which emphasizes growth and development , rather than the mere feeling and experience of being in love . Self-Respect implies an ability to look and judge oneself , and True Friendship , which qualifies this important relationship in an evaluative ( true ) envelope . All of these appear consonant with psychoanalytic formulations of a " healthy " or idealized adult . The Terminal values ranked lowest are Salvation and National Security . These two fairly abstract , if not obtuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience . Salvation , based on a religious belief system , focuses on another life , and is clearly the least valued of the value system . National Security is also far removed from self-reflection and analysis , with its focus on the nation 's stance with regard to defense from international or domestic threat <p> The Instrumental values also reflect important ways of " being " from a psychoanalytic perspective . Loving and Honest are the two top values over the years of this study . Obedient , Clean , Polite , and Self-Controlled remain the four least important . This pattern has distinct implications . Surely this sample does not see obedience , politeness , and self control as very important . Intuitively , however , these values are generally viewed as being among the basic elements of etiquette and social grace in relating to others . Given the their devaluation in the psychoanalytic value profile , one may well have profound reservations about the quality of relationships by adherents to this value system . IMPLICATIONS AND LIMITATIONS <p> As noted above in the 1979-1993 comparison , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of psychoanalysts , and their values hierarchies were more alike than different . These results indicate a consistency in the values of psychoanalysts over the course of a 14-year span which suggests that professional participation in this field reveals a shared value system . The personal values of the therapists in this study might therefore be viewed as reflecting the values of the institution of **27;1732;TOOLONG psychotherapy . <p> It appears , then , that psychoanalysis may constitute an institution with a unique value system into which professionals are selected and become indoctrinated ( McLean , 1960 ; Michels &; Oldham , 1983 ) . Accordingly , students may choose the profession because its value system matches their own , selection committees embody the value system of the institution and may choose candidates likely to embrace similar values , and through participation in psychotherapy training programs and various professional activities , trainees are further indoctrinated into the value system of the institution of psychoanalysis . <p> Whereas this discussion has so far suggested that individual schools of psychotherapy represent their own unique value systems ( Weisskopf-Joelson , 1980 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents a shared value system , regardless of theoretical orientation . <p> Values are becoming more and more recognized as issues in psychotherapeutic discourse . These are reflected in basic reexaminations about the role of psychotherapy and psychotherapists in our culture . Some authors go so far as to de-mystify the elusive psychotherapy interaction to the implicit vocational " guild " category where practitioners are mere agents of the dominant culture : <p> Therapists are members of particular professional guilds , and they operate at the behest of specific societal constituencies . Subtly or boldly , the solutions they propose or support broker distinct political , economic , and social arrangements .... The most pernicious stance from which therapists can operate is the belief that they are simply " neutral " participants with no ax to grind .... Like it or not , therapists are social agents . Their work advances particular cultural agendas . Therefore , the conception of the therapist as a neutral conversationalist is an impediment to frank discussions of values , preferences , lifestyles , and social ethics . ( Efran , Aldorondo , &; Heffner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument , presented powerfully and definitively , might be used more productively by turning some of the statements into questions . In this age of " managed care , " there is little doubt that most therapists are less and less free agents ( if they ever were free ) . Implicit in the above , is that therapists may hold beliefs about themselves and their work which are illusory . One aspect underlying the entire argument is the accusation that therapists have an espoused value system while , in reality , transmitting another in their practice . The results of this study are in the service of attempting to identify one of these significant dimensions -- namely , the expressed values of the psychotherapists . <p> The arguments presented above by Efran et al . may be much more acute today . However , they have been , for some time , a continuous dilemma for the therapist in determining the extent to which to identify with the client 's interests against those of society vs. attempting to transmit society 's values and myths ( Wren , 1976 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by assuming that there is , ipso facto , a conflict between the values of society and those of the designated clients . If this indeed be so , the contradiction may well present an exposure of not only the values of psychotherapists , but also of societal values at large . <p> The results of this investigation seem to support the current position that there is very little in the social world which is value free . Freud 's position that the values of science are sufficient for psychotherapy is indeed a myth . The question now is not one of being value free and objective . Rather , it is an ongoing question of discovering just what the values of psychotherapy are . This study represents one small step in that direction . <p> The 1993 study attempted to address some of the limitations of the 1979 study by increasing the sample size considerably . It also was presented more anonymously , since it involved mailings rather than personal exchanges . An unexpected consequence of the different procedures is reflected in the higher return rate for the 1979 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 26% ) . Does this imply that the presence of the researcher who explains the study , addresses questions , and urges and encourages greater participation is indeed influential in maximizing participation ? The mailing , on the other hand , allowed distribution to a much larger potential audience ; although the percentage of return dropped considerably , the sample size was much higher . Moreover , it is difficult to speculate whether these nuances actually tapped different subsamples of the intended pool . SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION <p> The question of whether theories of psychotherapy represent " perceptual houses " with their own subsequent " institutional " value system was investigated . One theoretical orientation , **27;1761;TOOLONG psychotherapy and psychoanalysis , was selected as the sample . The Rokeach Value Survey was used to determine the values and value system of the respondents . The results indicate that there is both consistency and change in a comparison of the value system of psychoanalytic psychotherapists in 1979 and 1993 . However , certain values do seem to remain very stable or consistent . Of the Terminal values , Mature Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Salvation , National Security , and A World of Beauty are consistently ranked low . Of the Instrumental values , Loving , Honest , and Capable are consistently high , while Obedient , Clean , Polite , and Self-Controlled are consistently low . These values , therefore , seem to be a beginning of the specific identification of the values of psychoanalytic psychotherapists . It would therefore seem that the values of psychoanalysis are those one might call more personal than social ; individual ( self ) rather than communal ( the world ; society in general ) . Moreover , these values appear to be fairly uniform across the profession , and are not differentiated by age and sex . <p> This study examined only one theoretical orientation and is limited to that group only . Findings indicated that there is a shared and somewhat stable value system . It is important to note that this study , while longitudinal in design , did not actually measure changes in individual values of practitioners ; rather , it is longitudinal only insofar as it measured two samples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the institution is quite representative of the field by its prominence , it can not be stated unequivocally that the values of its members are indeed representative of their peers throughout the profession . <p> Limited as it was to psychoanalysts , the study does not answer the question about values in psychotherapy as an umbrella institution . Is this structure unique to psychoanalytic psychotherapy or does it reflect psychotherapy in general , regardless of theoretical orientation ? So we tentatively conclude that there seems to be a coherent system which may represent a " perceptual house , " but whether it is a one family house or an apartment house of many theoretical orientations awaits further study . <p> 
@@4001541 In April 1990 , I was in Japan for a United Nations conference , held in the industrial city of Sendai , on the relationship of science and technology to international peace and security . on the night before returning to the United States , while sleeping in a typical old-style Japanese inn in Kyoto , I had a dream on Earth Day ( April 22 ) that reflected my experience of coming back to a country that had been changed drastically from the place that I had once known . Thirty years ago , my wife and infant first son and I had lived for two years in Japan , a country of exquisite beauty , near Tokyo , in an old house with shoji screens and tatami mats . I returned to a polluted land desecrated by the mindless excesses of industrialization . on every small hill was a tower for power lines , which draped themselves ungracefully across the countryside , dominating the landscape of miniature rises and subtle contours . <p> In my dream , I am on a hillside just across the Hudson River , perhaps in New Jersey , which I had driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to the seashore . Someone is lecturing to a group of us , as if we were at the United Nations conference from which I have come to Kyoto , that there is still much beauty in the New York City environs . Then , with others from the conference , I take a kind of quick aerial and ground tour of these hills but see no beauty , for on each field of straw-colored New Jersey swamp grass there is at least one rectangular industrial or commercial building . Furthermore , there is an unmistakable chemical stench that pervades the scene , which is only partially acknowledged by the group . <p> The scene shifts to a meeting around a conference table where people are sharing their experiences and what bothers them . I say that what troubles me most , beyond what we have witnessed , is when someone , or a policy , or some enterprise , contradicts , or denies , or pretends that reality is different from that which my own experience tells me it is , that is , invalidates my direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me -- a kind of combination of an energetic representative of the British scientific establishment who was at the conference and of the younger people more eager for change-reacts with positive intensity to my sentiment , and I feel very much support . I will return shortly to certain of the dream 's meanings . A NEW PSYCHoLoGY oF THE ENVIRoNMENT <p> We sense now a need for a new psychology of the environment in order to understand what we have done , and continue to do , individually and collectively , to the Earth that is our home , so that we may change our behavior , locally and globally , in order to save its life . But how is this to be done ? How do we invent a new psychology of our relationship to the Earth ? use the word invent , because of its implication of creating something new , an entity , a combination that had not been put together before . <p> Without a human problem , there is no psychology , or at least not a clinical or dynamic one , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have existed before but which has gained preeminence as a result of new historical and cultural circumstances . Freud and his followers , to a degree , invented psychoanalysis in response to the fact that the extreme , deceitful ordering of men 's and women 's sexual lives by a rigidified bourgeois society was becoming emotionally intolerable and producing behavioral and physiological manifestations that could not be understood or treated by the medicine or neuropsychiatry of their day . We confront now a new kind of problem , global in scope , namely the agonizing murder of the life systems of the Earth , the home on which we depend for everything , which affects each of us in profound personal ways , no matter how intensely we may deny it . <p> This new psychology must include not only the development of a body of theory that would understand or interpret our relationship to the environment , but also ways of working with clients and patients that will bring forth direct or disguised thoughts and feelings in relation to the environment and empower constructive initiatives . At the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of distress about pollution or other forms of environmental destruction in dreams and other communications , that we not hear or interpret these simply as displacements from some other , inner source . For example , a young woman in a human growth workshop that I co-led in Manhattan complained that she could not do all of the work , which involved exercises using rapid deep breathing , because the air was too foul . " I ca n't breathe , " she said repeatedly . " It 's just too toxic . Are there chemicals stored here ? " ( There were not . The room we used was a dance hall on the lower West Side. ) others in the workshop resonated with this woman 's complaint and acknowledged the foulness of the city 's air , but they were able to complete this part of the workshop . Although her complaints could have been connected to early childhood experiences of disgust or intrauterine distress , there was no opportunity to explore this possibility . Yet the acknowledgment of the validity of her complaint enhanced postively her further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of psychology is relevant to a problem of this scope ? What would a psychology of the Earth be like ? It would need to be comprehensive , holistic , systemic -- I am not sure what the correct terms would be , except that they must convey the fact of wholeness , connection , interrelatedness , and complexity . It would have to be a dynamic psychology , in the sense that it would need to explore profound , largely ignored conscious and unconscious feelings , impulses , and desires in relation to the physical world , rather than one of the variations of neurophysiology or biochemistry that now dominate the American psychiatric establishment . In addition to recognizing the systemic nature of the problem , the practitioners of this dynamic psychology of the environment would need to tell unpleasant or unwelcome truths about ourselves -- here is one of the meanings of the dream -- as we have learned to do from psychoanalysis but now in an altogether new arena . We would need to explore our relationship with the Earth and understand how and why we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even in Freud 's time , dynamic psychology was relational , initially describing the forces connecting the agencies of the psyche ( id , ego , and superego ) , and between and among individuals in dyadic relationships , families , and small groups . But a relational psychology of the Earth would be much broader , including our connectedness to peoples and other creatures all over the planet and with the earth itself as a living entity . <p> Actually we ( by " we " I mean , by and large , citizens of Western and other industrialized nations because many native cultures experience and avow a very different relationship to their enviroment ) do have a psychology or at least a prevailing attitude , conscious and unconscious , toward the Earth . We regard it as a thing , a big thing , an object to be owned , mined , fenced , guarded , stripped , built upon , dammed , ploughed , burned , blasted , bulldozed , and melted to serve the material needs and desires of the human species at the expense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel at liberty to kill , paralyze , or domesticate for our own use . Among the many forms of egoism that have come to be the focus of psychodynamically oriented psychologists in an age of self-criticism about our narcissism , this form of species arrogance has received little scrutiny . This attitude contrasts dramatically with the pragmatic , live-and-let-live , and reverential relationship with nature that is reflected in the words of native American leaders such as Chief Seattle ( 1988 ) and Sioux Medicine Man John ( Fire ) Lame Deer ( 1972 ) , who recognized our complete interdependence with the Earth and the need to live in balance and harmony with nature . " This we know , " Chief Seattle told a Pacific Northwest Assembly in 1854 , <p> The earth does not belong to man ; man belongs to the earth . This we know . All things are connected like the blood which unites one family . All things are connected . Whatever befalls the earth befalls the sons of the earth . Man does not weave the web of life , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the web , he does to himself . ( P. 71 ) <p> More than a century later Lame Deer wrote , <p> To come to nature , feel its power , let it help you , one needs time and patience for that . Time to think , to figure it all out . You have so little time for contemplation . it 's always rush , rush , rush with you . It lessens a person 's life , all that grind , that hurrying and scurrying about . ( P. 2 ) <p> The seemingly mindless destruction of the natural landscape by the Japanese , a people who have been known for their delicate appreciation of nature , attests to the degree to which industrialization and accretion of wealth can overwhelm such sensitivities and separate us from the Earth itself . This cutting off consciousness from a connection with nature and the spirit that most peoples throughout human history have experienced as inherent in it ( and in us , of course , as part of nature ) , is one of the supreme negative achievements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painfully demonstrated in modern Japan and is reflected in my dream . one must wonder how or why we have done it , how we have so overdeveloped the use of reason at the expense of feeling in the service of a fear-driven need to conquer other peoples and the material world on a planet with a growing population that is perceived as yielding finite , diminishing resources . Chief Seattle shared this bewilderment . " In your perishing you will shine brightly , " he warned , " fired by the strength of the God who brought you to this land for some special purpose and gave you dominion over this land and over the red man . That destiny is a mystery for us ( Chief Seattle , p. 72 ) . <p> So a psychology of the environment would be an expanded psychology of relationship , a conversation of experiencing in the deepest parts of our being , of our connection with the Earth as sacred . I say sacred because I do not believe that a mere threat to survival will be sufficient to create this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our being . THE INCLUSION OF SPIRITUAL ELEMENTS <p> But here we encounter a problem in developing the new psychology , for it must by virtue of the very nature of the task be a psychology which includes a powerful spiritual element . This will mean , for example , a reanimation of the forests and of nature , which we have so systematically and proudly denuded of their spiritual meaning . As a recent article in the newsletter of the International Research Center for Japanese Studies ( Nichibunken ) entitled " Animism Renaissance , " which acknowledges Japan 's " responsibility for a great deal of destruction of tropical rain forests " ( p. 2 ) , points out , " severe natural destruction started at a point parallel with that of the disappearance of Animism " ( p. 4 ) . <p> Here then is the problem . By and large , we in the West have rejected the language and experience of the sacred , the divine , and the animation of nature . our psychology is predominantly a psychology of mechanisms , parts and linear relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how powerful , that can not be quantified , and we distrust the language of reverence , spirit , and mystical connection , recalling perhaps with fear the superstitiousness and holy wars of earlier periods . Academic psychology , now embodying a reverence for numbers , tight reasoning , and linear thinking in opposition to intuition , direct knowing , and subjective experience is likely to look askance at efforts to reinfuse its body with the imprecise notions of spirituality and philosophy , from which it has so vigorously and proudly struggled to free itself in an effort to be granted scientific status in our universities , laboratories , and consulting rooms . <p> This can not be helped , for the route to a new psychology of the environment , which might contribute to our protecting it , probably can not be achieved by measuring our reactions or talking about the problem . only experiences that profoundly alter our view of nature and reconnect us with the divinity in ourselves and in the environment can empower people to commit themselves to the prodigious task before them . The therapeutic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our being so that we experience the Earth in its living reality . This is why people like Walter and Ellen Christie ( 1984,1985 ) , Joanna Macy ( 1988 ) , and Stanislav and Christina Grof ( 1988 ) , who have been pioneers in creating methods of reconnecting us with the Earth and with ourselves in nature , rely on experiential , imaginal , and consciousness altering or opening approaches . Interestingly , people who open themselves to this connection , discovering their " ecological selves , " seem often now to encounter disturbing images , bad smells , and other psychological experiences of the earth 's desecration in their dreams , fantasies , and deeper consciousness . This can become intolerably painful but also seems to empower people , impelling them to take action on behalf of the deteriorating environment . I have been struck by the fact that powerful images of the Earth 's polluted landscape are appearing with increasing frequency on the covers of leading magazines and in a proliferation of articles in newspapers , magazines , and books , as well as in television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth . It is also possible that these images are now significantly penetrating our cultural consciousness and may contribute to fundamental changes in behavior and policy . INSTITUTIONAL , STRUCTURAL , AND SYSTEMIC REALITIES <p> What I have described so far is , in a sense , the easy part of the problem . Deepening our conscious awareness , reanimating our connection with the Earth , is important and can lead to responsible initiatives by individuals . But the stench of my condensed Japanese-New Jersey dream landscape , the pollution of our world , and the destruction of its resources by the Earth 's expanding population are the problems of mankind as a whole , acting collectively through institutions , especially business corporations , often with direct or indirect governmental support . A psychology of the environment to be meaningful must address these powerful institutional , structural , or systemic realities . Social institutions are , in a sense , the expressions of our collective psyches . But we come so much to take their existence and modes of operating for granted that to consider openly that we have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inevitably , encounter intense resistance because of the political , economic , and psychological vested interests with which they are associated . To bring about structural changes of this kind , psychologists will need to work closely with policy makers , corporate leaders , economists , and many people representing other related disciplines and groups committed to social change . <p> The political and personal resistance to environmental transformation can be flagrant . When I was in Japan , I read that industrial pollution in Korea had become so severe that , among other things , the water in the public water system in Seoul was condemned as unsafe to drink . A professor at Seoul University who documented the severity of the industrial pollution problem was fired from his position , and people who supported environmental change were accused by the government of being communist sympathisers . I had a similar experience in Paris in 1988 upon returning from a conference in Findhorn , Scotland , on " Politics as If the Whole Earth Mattered . " Fresh from hearing moving talks about the pollution problem and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared my experience and concern with a French psychologist , who dismissed these environmental concerns as communist propaganda , despite the fact that her own senses -- just breathing the air in Paris -- could confirm their truth . <p> Resistance to facing the costs of environmental transformation may extend beyond top management to the shareholders themselves . Initiatives proposed by shareholders from various environmental groups were overwhelmingly rejected by the vastly greater numbers of the company 's supporters at Exxon 's annual shareholders ' meeting in April 1990 . Pleas of wildlife destruction , poisoning of children by toxic chemicals , and other dangers from hazardous waste were ignored , presumably because reparative or healing actions might reduce shareholders ' profit margins and dividends . one Exxon spokesperson suggested to the environmentalists that they should " store your car , stop flying airplanes , and walk or ride a horse in the winter snow or summer heat " ( Hayes 1990 ) . over and above the speaker 's insensitivity , the remark is interesting for its implication , which is not so far off the mark , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a developed society and the fact or extent of industrialization itself . <p> It is not realistic to expect that the environmental crisis will be solved simply by deindustrialization . But the unwelcome news that the new psychology for the environment will need to communicate is that the unbridled license given in the West to free makes forces and the irresponsible overbuilding of heavy industries in the socialist systems have both led to the same disastrous result -- a planet dying in the excesses of human waste . As my barber put it , " Johnny , we are drowning in our industrial feces . " The greatest challenge that we now face in this rapidly changing world is to create political institutions that use the resources of power and responsibility in conjunction with economic structures that are accountable to future generations of human beings , to other species , and to the Earth itself . Psychologists of the environment , while enabling increasing numbers of people to connect with the Earth and its transcendent meaning , must also participate with committed citizens and with community and corporate groups in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transformation of our political and economic institutions . Ultimately , this means joining with others in a search for alternatives to the material values that now dominate the spirit in the United States and much of the world . AN INTERNATIONAL AND CROSS-CULTURAL ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT <p> An environmental movement on the scale necessary to bring about the changes that are essential for protecting the earth , a process to which psychology has a useful contribution to make , must be authentically international and cross-cultural in two senses . First , we in the West or developed countries must be aware of how powerfully precedent setting is our example . When we destroy our own forests , pollute our air , and poison our streams with our industrial and personal garbage , it little avails us to admonish developing countries for unhygienic industrialization . often heard arguments , such as the fact that we cut down our timber in a more orderly manner than the developing countries destroy their rain forests , become trivial in relation to the psychological and economic forces involved . Second , we need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples of developing countries . Campaigns to save natural resources , such as trees and animals , upon which impoverished peoples depend for their livelihoods , without addressing the material needs of those societies , can not be effective . CONCLUSION <p> In sum , a psychology of the environment to be comprehensive must include at least the following elements : An appreciation that we do in fact , have a relationship with the Earth itself , and the degree to which that relationship has become inimicable to the sustaining of the life of human beings and countless other species . An analysis of traditional attitudes toward the Earth in our own and other cultures that may facilitate or interfere with the maintenance of life . The dominant attitude to the Earth in the industrially developed countries has been one of unchecked exploitation . The application of methods of exploring and changing our relationship to the Earth 's environment that can reanimate our connection with it . These approaches must be emotionally powerful , experiential , and consciousness expanding , opening us to ourselves in relation to nature . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Political and economic systems , institutions , and forces embody collective attitudes toward the Earth and its living forms but have a compelling life of their own . Psychologists committed to environmental change must , therefore , work with professional environmentalists , policy makers , population experts , corporate leaders , economists , and representatives of relevant other disciplines to make these structures compatible with an environment that can support the continuation of human life and well being . This will mean , even more than in the case of the nuclear threat , that to be effective psychologists will need to become professionally and personally committed and involved outside of their offices and laboratories . We must discover new forms of personal empowerment for ourselves and our clients that integrate exploration and activism , becoming , men and women together , archetypal warriors in the battle to protect our planet . <p> Kurt Vonnegut ( 1990 ) has recently captured the monumental seriousness of the environmental problem . It is too serious , he says , to be dealt with through humor . " Jokesters , " he writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about challenges so real and immediate and appalling to their listeners that no amount of laughter can make the listeners feel safe and perfectly well again . I found myself doing that on a speaking tour of campuses in the spring of 1989 , and canceled all future engagements .... I said that the whole world faced a problem far worse than the rise of another Hitler , which was our destruction of the planet as a life-supporting apparatus of delicate and beautiful complexity . <p> I said that one day fairly soon we would all go belly up like guppies in a neglected fishbowl . I suggested an epitaph for the whole planet , which was : " We could have saved it , but we were too darn cheap and lazy . " ( P. 14 ) <p> 
@@4001741 Thank my fourth-grade teacher , Miss Schneider , for my introduction to Christmas . As public school teachers go , she was , I grant you , something of a religious fanatic ( among other things , she held Gospel study classes in pupils ' homes every Wednesday after school ) . I will never forget the day I sat on my front porch watching some twenty or so of my classmates follow Miss Schneider into the home of my neighbor and best friend just two doors down from me . Joining the class was " the thing to do , " and I could n't do it ; I was Jewish . To be sure , with what can only be described as conversionary zeal , Miss Schneider tried regularly to " remedy " my religious status , a project that led my parents to remove me from her classroom by February . But in December , I was still a Miss Schneider ward . And that is where I encountered Christmas . <p> I was later to find out , however , that when it came to Christmas , all my teachers were more or less Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into winter , even the most humanly sensitive , Constitution-loving , and open-minded teachers became carried away by the spirit of what we now call , euphemistically , the " holiday season . " By early November , the classroom was already being turned into a swiftly accelerating vehicle for welcoming Christmas . By late November , we had heard the Christmas story several times over . Red and green decorations floated lazily down from ceilings and doorways . A large decorated tree outfited the main hall , and a smaller one greeted visitors entering the principal 's office . In art class , you painted Christmas scenes ; in English class , you composed Christmas stories ; in music , you sang Christmas carols . A huge school-wide Christmas assembly , followed by a gala Christmas party , marked the end of the first semester , but everybody returned that night to hear the school 's crack choir present its annual Christmas concert . <p> As welcome as I was in my country , there were certain times when I suspected that as a Jew I did n't quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the annual Christmas fever that swept through almost everyone I knew , but passed me by . None of the Jews in my small town kept any Christmas customs in those days . The close-knit Jewish community , tiny enough to know everybody else 's business , would have looked askance at such a thing . Having a Christmas tree , for instance , would have been viewed as but one step short of apostasy . In larger communities though , a small minority of Jews did decorate their own trees , hang stockings and give gifts . It seemed the American ( if not the Jewish ) thing to do . <p> It was , and still is , no picnic explaining to your children that Jews do n't celebrate Christmas . They stare at you in disbelief . Everyone keeps Christmas , they plead . It is the topic of every television program , the display in every store window . The Radio City Music Hall features its annual Christmas spectacle and the Metropolitan Museum of Art displays Christmas artifacts . What do you mean , We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grinch ? maybe Scrooge ? <p> When my children were young , a well-meaning baby-sitter looking to be creative helped each child assemble a tiny Christmas tree , made of colored paper , cellophane , and fallen branches collected from the wintry outdoors . The children beamed at us with glee when we came home . What does a rabbi 's family do with a pair of ready-made , personally constructed Christmas trees ? Certainly not call them Chanukah bushes and compound the sin of syncretism , doing injustice both to Judaism and to Christianity at the same time ( fine irony to the " Chanukah bush , " given the fact that Chanukah arose as a festival celebrating the Hasmonean fight to keep Judaism free of foreign religious influence ) . Patiently , quietly , and with all the love we could muster , we explained to our children that as much as we adored the work of their hands , the trees had to go . We were Jews ; Christmas trees were for Christians ; it would be wrong for us to have them -- wrong because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made light of Christmas . Chanukah was important for Jews ; Christmas was sacred for Christians . But you ca n't be both Jewish and Christian , and you ca n't have both Chanukah and Christmas . It is one or the other . <p> Another year , Nick , our neighbor across the way , came to the door to announce his plans to show up in everybody 's living room somewhere around midnight , dressed in his Santa Claus suit . Did we want to be included in the list of stops ? The kids would love it , he assured us . We thanked him , but reminded him we were Jews . He knew that , but explained that lots of Jews would be on his list . What does a religious commitment to Judaism have to do with keeping or not keeping Christmas ? For that matter , what does Christmas have to do with Christianity ? For Nick , as for his Jewish takers , Christmas is just a fun time with music , parties , and wishes for world peace . Go argue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me who take Judaism seriously , however , that is not what Christmas is . It is a feast on the Christian calendar celebrating the incarnation of the son of God . I take seriously the religious significance Christmas has ( or should have ) for Christians . Since I 'm not a Christian , it is self-evident to me that I can not observe the occasion , not in good conscience , anyway , even though life would be a lot simpler if I could . <p> Historians tell us that Christmas was not always the cultural fulcrum that balances Christian life . There was a time when Christians knew that the paschal mystery of death and resurrection was the center of Christian faith . It was Easter that really mattered , not Christmas . only in the consumerconscious nineteenth century did Christmas overtake Easter , becoming the centerpiece of popular piety . Madison Avenue marketed the change , and then colluded with the entertainment industry to boost Christmas to its current calendrical prominence . <p> To be sure , my Jewish festival of Chanukah , which falls about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a sort of Jewish equivalent -- as in " Chanukah bushes . " It does n't matter when Chanukah falls . Since it is pegged to the Hebrew calendar , it may occur any time from late November to late December . Regardless of which it is , people wish me a " happy holiday " around December 25 , as if real holidays ought to happen then . <p> I have lit Chanukah candles happily and dutifully for almost half a century ; some of my fondest family memories consist of standing with my arms around my children as we sang Chanukah songs in the flickering candlelight . But the religious part of me regrets the fact that fewer and fewer Jews observe the High Holy Days , Shabbat , and even Passover ( which used to weigh in as everyone 's favorite ) , while more and more identify Judaism as a gift-giving cult centered on Chanukah . In any event , the Chanukah hype wo n't work It may sell merchandise , and even inspire Peter , Paul , and Mary to write " Light one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- but it wo n't make Chanukah into a Jewish version of Christmas , and it wo n't address the alienation of so many Jews who genuinely like the Christmas they see and feel all around them : a Christmas that they can not share . <p> Where I live , Christmas starts officially at the end of November , with Macy 's Thanksgiving Day parade . Cities outside New York schedule their own parades then , but Macy 's version typifies the genre . It takes no semiotic genius to get the message . The parade route winds down Broadway following its own " Yellow Brick Road " to the shopping mecca on Herald Square . Bringing up the rear , but leading the way for the folk who follow the official parade route is Santa Claus , who will soon reappear daily at malls around the country promising goodies to good little children . <p> I am no Scrooge . I like Santa Claus too . I like the Christmas music -- even the bad music -- that surrounds the Santa ritual ; I like the crisp winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the paraphernalia that make most people look forward to December 25 . I like my neighbors ' wreaths and their Christmas trees , and the mistletoe , and above all , the genuinely religious Christmas carols that you can hardly hear any more because they are being replaced by soppy songs that melt down the Christian message of this holy day as quickly as snow in a heat wave . Great music is great music , after all ; I enjoy it . <p> It is , in fact , my liking ( or not liking ) of Christmas that constitutes the key to the role of Christmas in American culture . By contrast , I neither like nor dislike Easter , just as I have no opinion of , say , Ramadan . As a Jew , I naturally evaluate my own holy days , but I generally feel compulsion to appraise the sacred calendar of others . Christmas is an exception to this rule . American mores expect me , even as a non-Christian , to welcome Christmas as a positive good in my life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin . An examination of that sin will tell us a good deal about what Christmas has become . <p> I have in mind three manifestations of Christmas in popular culture . The first two are modern-day fairy tales depicting the ultimate triumph of good over evil : the Broadway hit , Annie , and what , as I write , is being billed as " the summer movie of all time , " Batman Returns . To say that both have been box-office bonanzas is to be guilty of understatement . They obviously touch something very deep in our collective cultural psyche . <p> In both , Christmas appears as a symbol of the myth of American virtue . The Batman theme is simple and direct : the forces of good arrayed against the forces of evil . Unlike real life , however , from beginning to end , and no matter how bad things appear in the middle , not a soul in the movie theater has any doubt about who the final victor will be . It is only a matter of time until Batman wins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives happily ever after . That is the nature of fairy tales . They portray things as we wish they were , not as they are- . They may be absolutely ghoulish in the hideous trials to which the heroes are exposed , but in the end , Cinderella marries the prince , Little Red Riding Hood escapes the wolf , Hansel and Gretel do n't get baked in the oven , and Batman restores order to Gotham city . <p> What makes Batman interesting for our purposes is the fact that the hero 's triumph is portrayed against the backdrop of Christmas . The entire movie is set in the Christmas season . In his last line of the film , Batman links his own success at foiling the Penguin with the underlying theme of Christmas . " Merry Christmas , " he says , and good will toward men -- and women . " Christmas thus functions as a cultural trope for the way we wish things were , or better yet , the way we like to pretend things are . In the actual world bad things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prowl our land . The good-will quotient measured in the absence of ethnic , racial , and religious rivalries is rather low right now . But the myth of Christmas allows us to put aside untidy evidence from newspaper headlines and to believe instead that all 's right in Gotham . Christmas stands symbolically for a secular version of redemption : Jesus does n't save ; Batman does . If evil has been eradicated it must be Christmas , goes the logic , as in fact it is in Batman Returns . <p> The evidence from Annie is even more transparent . Annie is an orphan , who is adopted by Daddy Warbucks . Along the way , evil raises its ugly head in the shape of the manager of the orphanage and her brother , who virtually kidnap Annie by posing as her parents . But in the end , their scheme fails , and Annie returns to her wealthy benefactor . As in Batman , Annie too has been written so that it culminates in Christmas . In the very last scene , not only Annie , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warbucks ' mansion . If Batman is the myth of good conquering evil in general , Annie is the application of that myth to American values in particular . Daddy Warbucks is a self-made man , a shining example of what hard work and business enterprise will get you . Never mind the fact that he made his money as a war profiteer -- the play passes silently over the significance of his name , " Warbucks . " The point is that Warbucks made it on his own . He hobnobs with FDR and the White House crowd , gets J. Edgar Hoover to unleash the FBI in his search for Annie , and lives the life of luxury that is the stuff of the American dream . But the message of Annie is precisely that those dreams can come true , if only we are hard-working and virtuous . Annie , after all , escapes the orphanage . <p> Again , we are dealing with pure myth . In real life , almost no one is self-made any more . When Annie came out , it is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiring first-year graduates at astronomical sums . But most of America was getting poorer , not richer . Homelessness on a scale unknown since the Great Depression was about to become the norm for millions . Nonetheless , Annie told us confidently that even the poorest orphan could become a Warbucks heir . American capitalism triumphed once again . <p> In Annie , Christmas functions artistically not simply as the embodiment of moral victory but as a potent symbol for material success . The last scene focuses on munificent gift-giving . There is absolutely nothing spiritual about the day . No one sings Silent Night , let alone Adeste Fideles ; the birth of the savior is the farthest thought from anyone 's mind . Christmas , pure and simple , is nothing but the myth of endless American wealth born of capitalist entrepreneurship . The myth of secular redemption has reached its pinnacle here . <p> Add to Batman and Annie the third piece of evidence : Charles Dickens 's A Christmas Carol . Dickens wrote his masterpiece precisely at the time that Christmas was becoming the cultural focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Industrial Revolution , where , once again , the myth of capitalism was wrapped up in the tinsel of Christmas packaging . In reality , the terrors of the time are readily evident from almost every page of every book that Dickens wrote . But not here . The capitalist myth merges with Christmas as secular redemption allows Tiny Tim and his family to be saved from poverty ( not from sin ) and celebrate ( a feast , not a sacrament ) with Christmas plenty donated by none other than Scrooge himself . In his prerepentant days , Scrooge is the very antithesis of the capitalist ideal . He is a rich man like Daddy Warbucks , but he hoards his wealth and despises the poor . Naturally , he disdains-Christmas too . But in the end , he is converted . Christmas is the symbol for good will in general , gift-giving in particular , and the triumph of the capitalist ethic as a general good for one and all . <p> I now understand my own Christmas dilemma . Christmas has been secularized , " capitalized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certainly as popular culture presents it , it is the myth of the America we all pretend we inhabit : a place where Penguins are foiled , Annies are adopted , and even the poorest among us celebrate the wealth that comes from good old-fashioned hard work and industry . Not to observe Christmas is to blow the whistle on the myth , to expose such naked realities as a trickle-down economy where nothing trickles down , in a country rife with social ills and economic deprivation . <p> The problem is that even in its secularized form , Christmas is not religiously neutral . It is still Christian . So as a Jew , I am in a bind . I am naturally attracted to Christmas as mythic wish-fulfillment , marked by smiling Santas , festive parties , and gifts for everyone . At its secular best , it is at least one day in the year when we remember what we still might be : peaceful people infused with good will toward all , and a generous country , where everyone has a dinner to sit down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopting what is still , for me , a Christian feast with a Christian message . There may be two Christmases here , the age-old religious celebration and the modern secular one . But they are not easily separated . Religious Christians may well be uneasy about the triumph of the secular variety , but at least they do n't have to worry about sliding back and forth between the secular and religious landscapes . They can enjoy the American myth that the secular holiday presents and simultaneously observe the religious event for which Christmas was formulated in the first place . That is a luxury I can not afford . <p> On the other hand , I , along with most other Jews I know , have come to terms with our Christmas dilemma . By no means do I yearn to celebrate Christmas .

@@4002041 As the United States prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the 1955 act of civil disobedience by Rosa Parks , it is critical that any false emphases and flawed cultural myths associated with that December day be challenged and corrected . By exploring some of the historical-political , social , and personal influences that encouraged Parks 's refusal to move from her bus seat , it is possible to recognize in her deed the markings of a true prophetic act . <p> OVER THE YEARS , the historic event associated with Rosa Parks has been characterized in the following way : On December 1 , 1955 , in Montgomery , Alabama , a good-hearted , non-political , middle-aged seamstress was so tired from work that she refused to give up her seat on the bus ride home , indirectly setting in motion the Civil Rights Movement in the United States.

Unfortunately , it sidesteps the fundamental issue of racial injustice in favor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belligerent bus driver . It also ignores the mountain of evidence that insists Rosa Parks should never be characterized simply as a good-hearted seamstress . <p> As the United States prepares to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks 's act of civil disobedience , it is critical that the flawed cultural myths associated with that December day be challenged and corrected . What happened on that bus was far from haphazard or coincidental . By examining some of the factors that influenced Parks 's refusal to give up her bus seat , it is possible to recognize the markings of a contemporary prophetic act . <p> To assist in this process , two precedents , one scriptural and one historical , will be briefly considered . First , the Hebrew Scriptures contain the account of Jeremiah 's purchase of the field in Anathoth ( Jeremiah 32:1-15 ) . This act was basically an event in the form of a simile , for it suggested that just as the Anathoth field was sold to Jeremiah , other plots of land near Jerusalem would also be bought and sold in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a larger event , like the smashing of the potter 's vessel ( Jeremiah 19:1-13 ) that symbolized a coming destruction on a much larger scale . Rather it is the first purchase in what would be a long series of purchases occurring during an anticipated period of future restoration. ( n2 ) <p> Second , this incident involved the attribution of prophetic qualities to a type of action that might otherwise be considered quite ordinary . In normal times , buying a field of land was a commonplace occurrence . But , by buying a field already under the control of the invading Babylonian army , Jeremiah risked marking himself as a traitor . Only persons expecting to be able to retain ownership of their property under the conquering regime would have reasonably considered purchasing land at that time . Jeremiah , however , designated this act as symbolic of a promise made by the God of Israel that normal life would one day resume in the land. ( n3 ) Through this deliberate act , Jeremiah proclaimed a prophetic message of hope that would sustain the people during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be considered comes from an event that occurred 25 years prior to Parks 's act of civil disobedience , namely , the 1930 Salt March of Mahatma Gandhi . On March 12 , 1930 , Gandhi and 78 followers departed from his ashram outside Ahmedabad , intending to march 240 miles to the coastal city of Dandi . There Gandhi would lead the group in picking up natural sea salt , thus defying the oppressive Salt Laws and provoking a campaign of mass civil disobedience . Gandhi targeted these laws for three main reasons : they taxed the principal condiment of the poor ; they forbade the local manufacture of a bountiful natural resource ; and they fostered an unnecessary dependence on imported British goods. ( n4 ) The procession reached the sea on the evening of April 5 , but it was decided not to perform any acts of civil disobedience until the next day . Early on April 6 , Gandhi picked up some rough sea salt and reportedly said , " With this , I am shaking the foundations of the British Empire . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civil disobedience . By the end of the year , over 60,000 people were imprisoned for acts as seemingly minor as what Gandhi had done on the beach of Dandi . The impact of Gandhi 's prophetic act on both Indian and American history provides an excellent point of reference as we now return to Rosa Parks 's act of civil disobedience . <p> A key question associated with Rosa Parks concerns the reason why she refused to surrender her bus seat that day . The common explanation given is that she was tired . In responding to that perception , Parks adamantly insists her tiredness was not physical in nature . <p> People have said over the years that the reason I did not give up my seat was because I was tired . I did not think of being physically tired . My feet were not hurting . I was tired in a different way . I was tired of seeing so many men treated as boys and not called by their proper names or titles . I was tired of seeing children and women mistreated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tired of Jim Crow laws , of legally enforced racial segregation. ( n6 ) <p> In contrast to any simplistic interpretation of Rosa Parks 's refusal to move , at least 18 different motivating factors can be given that played a part in the events of that day . They will now be briefly described under the categories of historical-political , social , and personal influences . HISTORICAL-POLITICAL INFLUENCES <p> An initial historical influence on Rosa Parks 's act of civil disobedience was the impact Brown v. Board of Education had upon all people striving to remove the unfair laws of segregation . This landmark Supreme Court ruling ( handed down on May 17 , 1954 ) rejected the long-held belief that " separate-but-equal " educational programs were constitutional . It prompted a negative backlash among many White Southerners ; however it gave hope and encouragement to those suffering under racist and prejudicial laws , such as laws requiring segregated bus service . <p> A second influential historical event occurred about 15 months later , when an all-White jury acquitted two men accused of the brutal murder of Emmett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a 14-year-old youth from Chicago , was dared to say " Bye , baby " to a White shopkeeper in Money , Mississippi . He was later brutally murdered reportedly by the woman 's husband and a brother-in-law . Till 's mother demanded an open casket funeral in Chicago , which not only led to photographs of Till 's mangled body being printed in the media but also brought national and international criticism of Mississippi 's segregationist society . Rosa Parks was well aware of the details of this brutal event . <p> Another influence involves the activity of the Women 's Political Council ( WPC ) of Montgomery . At first glance , this seems to have been only an indirect influence since Rosa Parks was not a member of the group . However , the WPC had been in existence since 1946 with its primary focus being the removal of laws of segregation , especially in relation to the bus system . They had been entertaining the idea of a bus boycott for years and , under the leadership of Jo Ann Robinson , had begun shaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Given such mutual interests of Rosa Parks and the WPC , it would seem likely that Parks was aware of , and at least indirectly influenced by , some of the work of Jo Ann Robinson 's group . <p> A fourth historical influence is connected with the stories of the two other African American women who , in the months prior to Rosa Parks 's incident , were arrested for failing to move from their seats when ordered to do so by White bus drivers . On March 2 , 1955 , a 15-year-old high school student named Claudette Colvin was told to move from her seat in the non-reserved section of the bus , simply to accommodate White passengers with no seat . Colvin refused , so the driver tracked down a policeman and had Colvin arrested and forcibly taken away in a patrol car . In the end , because she was a minor , Colvin was found guilty of violating state laws , made to pay a fine , and remanded to her parents ' care . <p> The second case involved an 18-year-old girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vacate her bus seat . She was seated in the non-reserved section , but was fined for not obeying the bus driver 's request that she move farther back in the bus . For the Montgomery branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) , these incidents proved to be " trial runs " for envisioning how orchestrated efforts might succeed in removing the unjust laws of segregation. ( n7 ) <p> Many have wondered whether Rosa Parks was prompted by the NAACP local leadership to initiate action against the bus company . It is clear from Parks 's own comments that such was not the case . <p> People have asked me if it occurred to me then that I could be the test case the NAACP had been looking for . I did not think about that at all . In fact if I had let myself think too deeply about what might happen to me , I might have gotten off the bus . But I chose to remain. ( n8 ) <p> It must be conceded , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch of the NAACP and her friendship with chapter President E. D. Nixon significantly influenced her . One of her principal duties was cataloguing the cases of discrimination and racial violence in their community . This included many instances of lynching , rape , flogging , and unsolved murders . Thus , when the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in July 1955 that segregated bus seating was unconstitutional , considering ways to desegregate the Montgomery buses became an important topic discussed at NAACP meetings at which Parks took all the minutes . <p> A final historical-political influence to be mentioned here is the crucial impact of Parks 's attendance at the Highlander Folk School in Monteagle , Tennessee . Founded by Myles Horton , the Highlander Folk School strove to gather together integrated groups of people committed to social activism and educational reform . In the summer of 1955 , a two-week workshop was being held on " Radical Desegregation : Implementing the Supreme Court Decision . " Horton called Virginia Foster Durr , about whom more will be said later , to see if she knew of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program . She quickly recommended Rosa Parks and even arranged to find a sponsor to cover her transportation costs. ( n9 ) <p> Parks agreed to attend this workshop , even over the objections of her husband and despite the fact that it required her to take a leave of absence from her employer . The sense of genuine community and social concern that Parks experienced at Highlander left a strong impression upon her , which she keenly felt once she returned back home to her job and daily life in segregated Montgomery . SOCIAL AND FAMILY INFLUENCES <p> Rosa Parks often spoke about the women and men she admired and whose example she sought to emulate . These people played a supporting role in the 1955 drama on the Montgomery city bus . An initial social influence worth mentioning was Rosa Parks 's friendship with Virginia Durr , a committed activist for civil rights . A mutual friend introduced Rosa Parks to Durr , who soon discovered that Parks was an excellent seamstress and hired her to do alterations on family dresses . Soon the two women spent much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Durr was a mentor to her and one of the closest female friends she had in Montgomery. ( n10 ) <p> A second social influence on Rosa Parks was her inspirational encounter in 1955 with Septima Clark , who worked with Myles Horton as director of the workshops at the Highlander Folk School . Clark was a born activist and strong proponent of integration across American society . The Highlander experience of interracial camaraderie coupled with learning from women of conviction such as Septima Clark had a definite impact on Rosa Parks 's worldview and commitment to social justice . <p> A further social influence on Rosa Parks was her friendship with and admiration for E. D. Nixon , the leader of the local branch of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters and one of the founders of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP . Parks had known Nixon since 1943 , working closely with him as secretary of the local NAACP chapter and advisor for the NAACP Youth Council. ( n11 ) She even followed him as his executive secretary when he was elected president of the Progressive Democratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she worked for Nixon without compensation . <p> In suggesting a fourth influence on Rosa Parks 's life , the focus now shifts from colleagues to members of her immediate family , beginning with her brother , Sylvester . When Sylvester returned from military service in World War II , the hypocrisy and prejudice prevalent in their home community was hard for both siblings to bear . Black soldiers , who had fought bravely in defense of the United States , often returned home to a nation that considered them " uppity " and " troublemakers " if they wore their uniforms in public . Uncomfortable with such prejudicial treatment , in late 1945 Sylvester packed up his wife and two children and moved to Detroit , where he took a job at a Chrysler factory . The yoke of segregation thus caused some of Parks 's closest relatives to flee her home community . <p> An additional influence on Rosa Parks was the courage she witnessed in her mother , Leona McCauley , and her maternal grandparents . In her book Quiet Strength , Parks speaks proudly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and emphasis on believing in oneself " even while living under racist conditions . " She also mentions how her Grandma Rose was an example of care and love while still being strong-willed and a strict disciplinarian. ( n12 ) But then she moves on to the figure of her grandfather , Sylvester Edwards , who was someone that Rosa Parks consistently describes as an influential figure in her life . Born a slave , Sylvester Edwards was light-skinned and dared to break the social taboos of the day by shaking hands with Whites and calling them by their first names . But the cruelty he had personally experienced in his life made him quite hostile toward Whites . He was adamant that his children or grand children never work as domestic servants in White households . Parks makes these telling remarks : " His memory will always be with me . While I do not think I inherited his hostility , my mother and I both learned not to let anyone mistreat us . It was passed down almost in our genes . " ( n13 ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Rosa Parks 's husband , Raymond . Almost exactly ten years older than Rosa , Raymond was a barber by trade and a charter member of the Montgomery chapter of the NAACP . When they were first introduced , Raymond was fixated on bringing about justice for the recently imprisoned Scottsboro Boys , even though to do so was to risk being beaten or killed . In the years prior to December 1955 , Raymond 's commitment to civil rights and his active involvement in the NAACP were probably the dominant forces in Rosa Parks 's evolving spirit of civil disobedience . To quote her directly , Parks said : " He was the first man of our race , aside from my grandfather , with whom I actually discussed anything about the racial conditions . He was the first real activist I ever met. " ( n14 ) PERSONAL EXPERIENCES AND CHARACTER TRAITS <p> One difference between descriptions of prophetic activity from biblical eras and modern eras is that , in the former , the dynamic of psychological motivation is left relatively unexplored . It is one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be quite another thing to attempt to characterize the emotional and internal influences active in any specific act of volition . But since Rosa Parks has been asked so often to explain why she did what she did , her responses , plus comments made by her friends and associates , provide excellent source material for recognizing a number of personal factors that can be said to have influenced Parks 's act of civil disobedience . <p> An initial personal influence , and the one that is most commonly mentioned , is that she was physically tired after a busy day of work . If physical fatigue was a factor in Parks 's decision not to surrender her seat , it was a fairly remote one . It is true that she had worked all day , including a " working lunch " in the office of attorney Fred Gray , and she was anxious to get home to rest for a brief period before leading the regular Thursday evening NAACP Youth Council meeting . But on that particular day , it was clear that she was burdened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal influence was the disparity Parks had experienced between different bus systems in her own community . In 1941 , Parks got a job at Maxwell Field , a nearby Army Air Corps base . On the U.S. military base , she rode on an integrated trolley , often sitting side by side with White colleagues and enjoying conversation together . Once she left the base , however , she was forced to ride on segregated city buses . Parks felt this discrepancy to be a personal " humiliation " and insists that the experience opened her eyes by showing her " an alternative reality to the ugly racial policies of Jim Crow . " ( n15 ) <p> A third personal influence is a quality of Rosa Parks that is frequently mentioned by those who know her well , that is , a steely inner strength . Her long-time associate , Elaine Steele , has remarked that Parks is a person who is very peaceful but with great power . <p> She can very quietly say " no " or " I prefer not " and you know instinctively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the way the bus driver must have felt on that particular day when he asked " Are you going to move ? " and she said " No , I am not . " He did n't have to debate the point any further. ( n16 ) <p> Along with Parks 's inner strength , a fourth personal influence was her strong sense of pride . One minor incident points this out . When Parks accepted the scholarship to attend the Highlander Folk School , she supposedly accepted luggage and a swimsuit from Virginia Durr ; however , Parks disputes this detail in her autobiography . Durr responded in her own book , saying : <p> Rosa Parks is one of the proudest people I 've ever known in my life . She hated to admit that she did n't have a suitcase or bathing suit or money . It was painful for her . She was a very proud woman , so all of this had to be accomplished with a great deal of tact , which I am not noted for. ( n17 ) <p> While learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives credit to Miss Alice Winter , one of her early schoolteachers . Parks comments that she learned at Miss White 's school that she was " a person with dignity and self-respect " and that she should not set her sights lower than anybody else just because of her race. ( n18 ) <p> As a corollary to this strong sense of pride , an additional personal influence was the fact that Rosa Parks had a lingering resentment toward James F. Blake , the bus driver who confronted her on December 1 , 1955 . She did not know Blake personally ; she did not even learn his name until her subsequent trial . But they had already had an unfortunate encounter 12 years prior. ( n19 ) One sad feature of segregation was the habit of many bus drivers to require Black passengers to pay for their ticket at the front of the bus , before disembarking and reboarding at the rear of the bus . James Blake had a reputation for being especially abusive toward African American women , as well as taking malicious pleasure in having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then leaving them stranded before they could reboard at the rear . <p> One November day in 1943 , Rosa Parks boarded a bus through the front door and moved to stand in the aisle in the appropriate section in the rear . She had done this because there was no way to enter the bus from the rear , since every seat in the back of the bus and place in the rear stairwell and aisle were already full . James Blake was the driver that day and demanded that she exit immediately . When she refused , he told her to get off of " his " bus . Parks refused to move . Blake stood up and began pulling on her coat sleeve . She warned him not to strike her and said that she would leave . However , she further infuriated Blake by intentionally dropping her purse near the front of the bus and briefly sitting in a " Whites Only " seat before finally exiting the bus . For the next dozen years , Parks consciously avoided riding in any bus driven by Blake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous incident of 1955 was only possible because Parks had neglected to notice who was driving the bus when it stopped to pick up passengers near her place of work . Her act of civil disobedience was surely influenced by a long-remembered sense of moral outrage felt toward James Blake . <p> A sixth , and , in my opinion , the most important personal influence affecting Rosa Parks 's decision not to move from her bus seat was her deeply rooted Christian faith . Invariably , when Parks is asked about the events that day , she uses language that is faith-based and confessional in nature . When a schoolgirl from Detroit wrote to Parks , asking what gave her the courage to say " No " and not move to the back of the bus , she replied : <p> God has always given me the strength to say what is right . I did not get on the bus to get arrested ; I got on the bus to go home . Getting arrested was one of the worst days in my life . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong believer in God , I knew that He was with me , and only He could get me through the next step . <p> I had no idea that history was being made . I was just tired of giving in . Somehow , I felt that what I did was right by standing up to that bus driver . I did not think about the consequences . I knew that I could have been lynched , manhandled , or beaten when the police came . I chose not to move , because I was right . When I made that decision , I knew that I had the strength of God and my ancestors with me. ( n20 ) <p> According to her biographer , Douglas Brinkley , " faith in God was never the question for Rosa Parks ; it was the answer . " ( n21 ) <p> In summary , what is the significance of this survey of possible influences shaping Rosa Parks 's decision not to surrender her bus seat ? Consider the fact that when material from the Hebrew Scripture is studied in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process has occurred even before one begins . This is because all descriptions of biblical prophetic activity come to us in a redacted form . The material has been edited and shaped according to implicit criteria , such as the goal of authenticating Jeremiah as a true prophetic figure and presenting his messages as being valid expressions of the word and will of God for the Judahite community . <p> This is quite different from considerations of modern prophetic acts . While redaction of contemporary historical events can and does occur , exegetes of such events are also active participants in determining the events ' overall significance . They seek out first-person accounts , read biographical material , interview witnesses , and reach conclusions based on varying degrees of critical research . Moreover , the question of " Why did she or he do that ? " is always asked of modern prophetic acts with the expectation that an answer can be discovered . By comparison , this question can only be answered in a speculative fashion in reference to biblical prophetism . Therefore , it is prudent to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern figures . Far from secularizing or demythologizing examples of contemporary prophetism , such in-depth , historical-critical , psychological , and sociological examination helps in rendering judgment as to their authenticity and efficacy , while possibly shedding light on what may have been involved in similar prophetic examples from the Hebrew Scripture . RECOGNIZING THE PROPHETIC QUALITY OF ROSA PARKS 'S ACT <p> In order to offer a provisional evaluation of whether Rosa Parks 's act of civil disobedience should be considered a modern prophetic act , the earlier biblical and historical precedents will now be revisited . In recalling the prophet Jeremiah 's decision to purchase the field in Anathoth , it was mentioned that making this land purchase during a time of enemy siege was considered dangerous and foolhardy . It created the appearance that Jeremiah was in league with the Babylonians , hoping to retain possession of the land once the invading army conquered Jerusalem . As such , Jeremiah 's prophetic act was done at great personal risk . The same could be said of Parks 's prophetic act . By refusing to move , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of being forever redefined as that of a questionable troublemaker . In the aftermath of her act , Parks received a barrage of death threats. ( n22 ) She went against her husband 's wishes by her willingness to become a public figure , enduring his repeated warning , " Rosa , the White folks will kill you . Rosa , the White folks will kill you . " Her act led directly to her losing her job and her husband 's resignation from his barber 's job. ( n23 ) She also knew that she was endangering her entire family , including her frail mother . Yet she agreed to make her legal case a means to challenge the unjust status quo . <p> Parks 's act and Jeremiah 's purchase of the Anathoth field are also similar in being prophetic acts of hope in times of crisis . Both involved ordinary activities ( the buying and selling of land , riding home from work on public transportation ) whose " ordinariness " belied the crisis settings at hand ( siege of Jerusalem , Montgomery 's laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embody Jeremiah 's promise that one day , " houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land " ( Jeremiah 32:15b ) . Similarly , refusing to be coerced to vacate her bus seat became a means to embody a social vision that no longer allowed rules about a person 's skin color to dictate whether a wide array of services or common courtesies will be offered . Both acts took a present event to show forth a possible future reality . And both acts relied on a foundation of communal faith and religious conviction . <p> Comparisons with Gandhi 's Salt March of 1930 are also instructive . Both Gandhi 's march and Parks 's refusal to move were public acts , performed by people considered to be weak or non-threatening by the dominant social powers . Both were challenging a relatively minor law but one that touched on fundamental quality of life issues for the oppressed population . And both acted out of sincere faith foundations and philosophical convictions , consciously choosing to defy laws that were unjust so that all people might experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contemporary prophetic acts , these comparisons to biblical and historical precedents are helpful , yet not fully adequate in themselves . Theologian Paul Tillich has suggested that prophetic moments are also crisis moments , in which , at the " fullness of time , " the negativities of society are challenged by bearers of a prophetic spirit . He described such prophetic activity as kairotic in nature , transformational and directed toward what is unconditional. ( n24 ) Is it then possible to speak about a kairos moment occurring on that December day in Montgomery , Alabama ? <p> Throughout Brinkley 's biography , one recurrent question is whether or not Parks 's actions were premeditated . In his opinion , the answer is a clear " no . " As he puts it , a " lifetime 's education in injustice -- from her grandfather 's nightly vigils to the murder of Emmett Till -- had strengthened her resolve to act when the time came . " ( n25 ) Martin Luther King , Jr. , echoed these sentiments in his book Stride toward Freedom , when he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accumulated indignities of days gone and the boundless aspirations of generations yet born . She was a victim of both the forces of history and the forces of destiny . She had been tracked down by the Zeitgeist -- the spirit of the time . " ( n26 ) <p> Although she never uses the specific term kairos , this sense of the " fullness of time " is present in Parks 's own summary of her action : " God provided me with the strength I needed at the precise time when conditions were ripe for change , " ( n27 ) Knowing that other women at other times had reacted to bus segregation in the same way as she had , but without it leading to an effective , enduring bus boycott , Parks came to recognize a kairotic quality to the events associated with her prophetic act that day . <p> Rosa Parks 's act of civil disobedience merits recognition as an example of a contemporary prophetic act . It was a deliberate act of witness , performed by a person grounded in a faith community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . The most fitting way to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Parks 's historic act is to peel back the sentimental veneer from our recollections of that day . It is time to acknowledge finally the depth of prophetic spirit active both in Parks 's faithful witness and in the larger community around her . <p> Before leaving the story of Rosa Parks , one final moment of irony is worthy of mention . The Montgomery bus boycott lasted for 13 months , until the Supreme Court rejected the segregationist position of the Montgomery City Commission and ordered that by December 20 , 1956 , all the buses be integrated by law . On the morning of December 21 , 1956 , a reporter and photographer from Look magazine knocked on Rosa Parks 's door and persuaded her to have her picture taken riding a bus on that first day of integration . The famous subsequent photograph , showing Rosa Parks glancing out a window with a White male passenger seated in the row behind her , just happened to be taken on a bus driven that day by @ @ @ @

With the Applied Economics program , teachers find that such a curriculum is now available to them . <p> The research on Applied Economics , taken from external evaluations conducted at three-year intervals , reveals that the program 's active learning components are its most effective . The teacher ( who conducts the course four days a week ) and the consultant ( who visits on the fifth school day ) can introduce students early in the semester to the Student Company , an activity in which students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm . This might be followed by the Management and Economic Simulation Exercise , or MESE , a computer-based microeconomic simulation . <p> Applied Economics students could advance to Macroland during the latter part of the semester .

Mark Sperling , in an accompanying article , describes his use of MESE and Macroland with students at Cass Technical High School in Detroit . <p> The hands-on learning does not end with these activities . The student study guide , for example , contains many exercises that reinforce the concepts , generalizations , and other information introduced in the text . The program guide also offers a range of activities to engage students intellectually in problem solving and critical thinking . <p> Many Applied Economics classes examine current economic issues , such as teens in the labor force , the health-care crisis , and the new European Community 1992 , through Talks to Teachers . This quarterly publication is an eight-page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topic . <p> To assess class as well as individual progress during the semester , teachers can administer two forty-five-item pre- and post-tests of equivalent scope and difficulty . These tests are provided with the curriculum , and many teachers use them extensively . During the semester , teachers can generate end-of-chapter or -unit exams from a computer database of over 400 items . Finally , Applied Economics comes with a 100-item final exam that covers all the topics studied in the course and represents different levels of difficulty . <p> AE Rural Expansion and AE-by-Satellite <p> Through a delivery system tailored for small cities and towns , Applied Economics now is reaching many more rural school districts throughout the country . This system uses video tutorials to explain the program to school administrators and to train classroom teachers and business consultants .

@@4002341 By performing one political action , a citizen may simultaneously accomplish both a practical and a symbolic result . For instance , in the act of voting , one not only participates in the determination of public policy but also expresses enthusiasm and discontent , achieves a sense of common social ties , and approves the actions taken by society ( Edelman 1967 , 203 ) , Symbolic political behavior has been a subject of concern to students of politics for decades ( Arnold 1947 ; Edelman 1967 ; Elder and Cobb 1983 ; Kertzer 1988 ; and Hinckley 1990 ) . The addition of symbolism exercises to a secondary-school government class can provide a realistic approach to government in action . <p> The symbol may be on the visible or concrete level , such as the United States Capitol , or an audible impression , such as the sound of Big Ben as a background to Winston Churchill 's wartime speeches ( Reid 1970 ) . The symbol may also be more impressionis-tic and invisible ; for example , legislative statutory attempts to regulate a certain function may convey the idea that the function is well in control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulation that is enacted with the greatest fanfare is often the least ambitious ( Edelman 1967 , 26 ) . Students at the secondary level are capable of thinking symbolically , using a high level of thought processes . Activities that are organized to elicit symbolic responses in the study of government provide students with the opportunities to use their imagination to create a new and different way to look at an idea , value , fact , or object . The Symbolism Exercise <p> In a symbolic exercise , the aim is to encourage the students to obtain a greater understanding of the relationship between the symbol and the apparent dimensions of political phenomena . To begin the exercise , the teacher needs to describe to the class the concept of symbolism in the community in a variety of forms . The forms include the object , the activity , or the issue as a representation of an alternative , often deeper , meaning . The examples of community concerns given to the class should be limited in number so that the creativity of the class members is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one student is selected to list each student in the class by name , give a number to each of them , and describe in a word or two the symbols illustrated by each student . As the students present their symbols , the other class members note the numbers of the presentation that are considered to be the most effective or interesting . At the end of the presentations , the class members select three of the items . The student maintaining the list may be asked to restate the items offered and their numbers in order to assist the voting process . Once the ballots are collected and tallied , they become the basis for granting some reward -- perhaps a few points on the next test -- to the highest vote-getters . <p> Usually students offer a wide range of symbols that relate to community studies . The most common format is the picture ; however , the depictions may have varied levels of symbolic value and depth of emotion . The choice may range from a picture of a government building to some beneficial or destructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in devising items to serve as symbols of their ideas . In one instance , ajar of mud rap-resented the problem of run-off into ponds and streams from the construction of a local mall . Students have displayed various religious writings to symbolize the separation of chumh and state or the influence of religious law upon the domestic law . A parking ticket indicated the penalty exacted by society for violation of its rules . <p> Class members have drawn cartoons of contemporary politicians and political controversies . One student wrote a poem that incorporated the principles dealt with in class and their relationship to the lengths she would go to obtain a good grade . Students played bits from video and audio tapes , which enlivened the class . With a video , a student may depict power or corruption , as it was shown in a movie . An audio tape may be a brief but strong commentary on a social problem or the refusal of those in authority to correct a condition the student considers to be an injustice . <p> Table I is a compilation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courts , and justice in a local community . Symbols such as those have a particularly interesting effect on government students . Learning Issues <p> The symbolism exercise relates closely to other types of teaching methods . Each student presentation provides a simulation , but on a single dimension . Often , the symbols used in several presentations may be related to each other by the teacher to form a more complex simulation . Further , the symbols selected by the students often provide a guide to their insights into ethics or character matters . For instance , the coat hanger in Inherit the Wind will elicit certain points of view that are controversial in nature . This can evolve into a values clarification exercise if the teacher chooses to do so . The reference to certain symbols can also relate to the clarification of values . This may be accomplished by follow-up discussion of symbols that reveal student impressions of their view of issues that the symbols present . <p> Symbolic representation is relatively high on the scale of complexity of learning activity . For example , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third level of complexity and has implications for the remaining upper three levels as well ( Bloom 1985 ) . Evaluation <p> The exercise described here can have many positive results . The students furnish a variety of interpretations and perceptions of the issues , personalities , and other topics that they consider to be important . These perceptions are often based upon the students ' backgrounds and provide an understanding of ethnic heritage and other deeply held feelings . The offering of a symbol of an intensely held point of view may add high drama to a class . Class members may indicate by their quiet attentiveness a concern for the presenters ' ideas and beliefs . The exercise promotes cohesion and morale in the class . <p> The level of motivation of the class often increases , largely because the group finds this to be a different and refreshing activity . Because the exercise calls for a different set of performance skills , students who are not usually involved or interested may " shine . " For instance , a student who is good at seeing relationships may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be interested in the reward for participation . <p> We have found that the use of symbolism results in a deeper understanding of topics to be learned . The students as peers help each other to interpret various meanings from the items of subject matter that they choose to illustrate . The teacher then may select several of the symbols as springboards for further exploration , and the students will usually have an interest in the topic and see its relevance . Achieving these two features of the instruction process -- inter-est and acceptance of relevance -- would otherwise require considerable effort by the instructor . <p> In balance , the negative aspects of introducing symbols in class are few . The exercise can be accomplished in two class periods , one for instruction and assignment , and one for the actual presentations by the students . Although some teachers may see the exercise as no more than simple " show and tell , " the results can be very complex because students are moved to a deeper sense of relevance about the subject matter . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher to build wider applications of the topic . The use of such an exercise can be very effective in the extension of the learning process . Teaching , which can be both enjoyable and frustrating , is rewarding when the use of symbolism in the classroom helps engage students in learning about the community . PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> 
@@4002441 Educating a first generation of citizens to take their place in a democratic society is as essential today as it was over 200 years ago . Just as teachers in our world 's emerging democracies are trying to ready new generations for a democratic life , so were America 's first educators concerned with a similar task . Teachers in today 's Russia or Kyrghizstan accept the importance of the school and its curriculum as crucial to the development of a child 's democratic attitude ( Wile 2000 ) . America 's first educators made the same assumptions . <p> Constructing the first modern democracy in history , American educators were pioneers in the business of educating democratic citizens . Rejecting what they considered as the autocratic and irrelevant knowledge of a traditional European education , many looked to more practical skills and knowledge necessary for a citizen 's activist democratic role . To accomplish that task , they needed a new curriculum . <p> In this article , I show how a curriculum similar to the Expanding Environments curriculum was an important key to citizenship education in America 's first schools . The Expanding Environments theory , attributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , suggests that teachers begin the sequence of social studies -- citizenship education -- by introducing the more personal and current concepts of self and community in the early grades and by expanding to the less personal and distant concepts of nation and world in the higher grades . Although no one knows exactly when this curriculum theory emerged , Hanna 's influential 1962 article connects his name to the idea . <p> Advocates of this curriculum theory , however , do exist earlier in America 's educational history . Early twentieth century educators like John Dewey and Lucy Sprague Mitchell ( 1878-1967 ) argued that it was necessary to connect students to their world by having them look at their familiar surroundings . Dewey ( 1929 ) claimed that memorization of disconnected facts actually harms young children . He wrote , " The school must represent present life-life as real and vital to the child as that which he carries on in the home , in the neighborhood , or in the playground . . . . Much of present education fails because it neglects the fundamental principle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 ) . <p> Influenced by Dewey 's work , Lucy Sprague Mitchell built on Dewey 's principle by emphasizing the " here and now " through her " curriculum of experience " ( Antler 1987 ) . Applying her theories to female college students in the first decades of the twentieth century , Mitchell , as dean of women at the University of California , enhanced what she viewed as a limited higher education for women by encouraging a first-hand , discovery approach . She developed the curriculum theory from her own personal learning style and attributed its success to two components : a learner 's direct exposure to real-life stimulation and the common learning experiences of teacher and student ( Antler , 112-13 ) . Later in her career , Mitchell successfully adapted her theories to the elementary social studies themes of geography and history . <p> Current advocates of curriculum emphasizing local and personal understandings include Gail Hickey , James Percoco , and advocates of constructivism . Hickey ( 2000 ) found that elementary teachers who use family and local history projects enhance the development of classroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have students explore the world around them . Constructivists like Novack and Gowan ( 1984 ) and Brooks and Brooks ( 1989 ) noted that active learning involves feelings and actions that are accomplished by making sense of one 's personal environment . They believed that children construct knowledge by connecting new information to existing understandings . <p> America 's first educators also reinforced personal and local understandings by introducing a curriculum of practical knowledge , reinforcing the behaviors and skills for dealing with one 's immediate surroundings . That curriculum was their key to citizenship development for a new democratic nation . To illustrate this point , I have analyzed a variety of New England textbooks that were published in the first few decades of the nineteenth century and have found that an emphasis on personal and local understanding fostered democratic citizenship development . America 's First Expanding Environment Curriculum <p> To create the first generation of democratic citizens in nineteenth-century America , such local New England educators as Jedediah Morse , Noah Webster , Hannah Adams , Caleb Bingham , and others wrote textbooks that were specifically designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted new Americans to understand their place in America 's past and present and to become active members of their community . Instead of beginning in the remote past or a faraway place , students immersed themselves in their own surroundings . In an effort to introduce educational material that was considered more relevant , useful , and practical for an American audience , those educators introduced content other than traditional Biblical and classical material . <p> Arguing that a local understanding was far more necessary for the development of democratic citizenship than a knowledge of Europe , educators wrote textbooks that emphasized the development of self , community , and country . Those textbooks established the scope and sequence of America 's first citizenship education curriculum ( Schwartz 2001 ) . To become active and productive citizens , educators believed , young Americans first had to understand themselves and their personal environment . Only then would students be able to relate the past to the present in a meaningful way . Themes of Early Citizenship Development <p> To accomplish the goal of creating contributing citizens , many early nineteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasized three important themes that were believed necessary to mold an activist American identity . The themes all stemmed from the personal and local aspects of life and included the development of common language and communication skills , the development of individual self-governance in the form of personal control and behavior , and an understanding of history as it connects to local and current issues and ideas . Such themes of citizenship appeared in the local reading , history , and geography textbooks of New England schools in the first few decades of the nineteenth century . <p> The distinction between various subjects was not as clear then as it is today . Readers , such as Webster 's ( 1814 ) Elements of Useful Knowledge , Piedmont 's ( 1824 ) The National Reader , and Bentley 's ( 1825 ) The American Instructor , all incorporated local history , politics , documents , and speeches as important reading material . Geography texts like Morse 's ( 1804 ) Geography Made Easy and his ( 1816 ) Universal Geography included historical and geographical material . Morse also instructed teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geography . <p> The first major theme throughout the textbooks was an emphasis on communication skills and a common language . Noah Webster was one of the first to believe that Americans should speak their own language ( Unger 1998 ; Nietz 1961 ) . Shortly after the American Revolution , Webster created a series of popular spellers , grammars , and readers . In the preface to his fourteenth edition of An American Selection , Webster ( 1814 ) describes the importance of " transfusing " famous American speeches " into the breast of the rising generation . " Fearing those speeches might become " neglected or forgotten , " Webster wanted new Americans to read , hear , and understand what noble rebelling colonists had felt during the recent revolution . He believed that those speeches were " not inferior to the orations of Cicero and Demosthenes " and would " impress interesting truths upon young minds " ( preface ) . <p> But Webster wanted his students to learn much more than words from the written speeches . He wanted the new U.S. citizens to develop such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webster and the other early educators believed that the development of an American language was an important component of citizenship development . To understand each other , people had to communicate properly and clearly . According to Webster ( 1815 , 5 ) , one important rule of speech was to " let the sentiments you express be accompanied with proper tones , looks , and gestures . . . . A speaker should endeavor to feel what he speaks . " Webster even gave specific directions for expressing certain " passions " or " sentiments , " like " mirth , pity , grief , and fear . " He described courage as " steady and cool passion that opens the countenance and gives the whole form an erect and graceful air . The voice is firm and the accents strong and articulate " ( 6 ) . He wrote , however , that boasting " is loud and blustering , . . . eyes flare , . . . the face is red and bloated " ( 7 ) . <p> Other contemporary reading textbooks echoed Webster 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the importance of language for citizenship . Rensselaer Bentley 's ( 1825 ) The American Instructor " initiates children into the first principles of our language " by instructing them in the " meaning of words " and " a sense of the writer " ( preface ) . After including the Declaration of Independence as a reading selection , Bentley declared , " This is the language of America , of Reason , and of Truth " ( 197 ) . Like Webster , Bentley wanted all American citizens to go beyond the mere knowledge of words ; he wanted new citizens to possess America 's language . " In every Town , County and State in America , " he noted , " are offices of honour and profit which some of you . . . will be called upon to fill . . . . To hold office U.S. citizens have to read well , write a fair hand , and understand the use of figures " ( 43 ) . Bentley even explained how two citizens should carry on a conversation : " Look him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer respectfully ; . . . let modesty and decency govern your words and deportment ; . . . do n't over speak ; . . . know when to be silent " ( 180-82 ) . <p> In a similar manner , Caleb Bingham ( 1815 ) wrote about the " Importance of Studying the English Language Grammatically " in his reader , American Preceptor . Just as the Romans and Greeks studied their own language , Bingham urged young Americans to study English because the " freedom , liberty , and the life of our country depend upon it " ( 156-59 ) . <p> Like the reading texts , the geography books emphasized local language and communication by introducing a vocabulary of place . Jedediah Morse ( 1804 ) noted in the preface of his book Geography Made Easy , " To discharge the duties of public office with honor and applause , the history , commerce , productions , peculiar advantages and interests of the several states ought to be thoroughly understood . " Morse lamented that until in the early 1800s , American students " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Asia , than that of their own state and country . . . . We have seldom pretended to write , and hardly to think for ourselves . " Morse and such other geography writers as Dwight ( 1795 ) , Olney ( 1828 ) , Willett ( 1814,1822 ) , and Goldsmith ( 1811 ) provided a common vocabulary of local geographical terms , places , maps , and features . Goldsmith even titled his book A Grammar of Geography , and Willett ( 1814 ) named his book An Easy Grammar of Geography . Obviously , geographic vocabulary terms were important . <p> An 1814 edition of Morse 's Geography Made Easy -- the eighteenth edition -- included an expanded vocabulary section that had grown from thirty pages and twelve definitions in the 1804 edition to fifty-two pages and thirty-four definitions . Some additions included such terms as political divisions of the Earth , inhabitants , forms of government , and religions . In both the definitions and descriptions of the Earth , the emphasis was on the local . For instance , in describing political divisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . the most improved . . . Africa the most barbarous . . . Asia the wealthiest . . . and America the largest , the grandest , as to its mountains and rivers , the least populous and wealthy " ( 43 ) . In his 1804 edition , Morse defined America 's waterways , as the world 's greatest : " no part of the world is so well watered with springs , rivulets , rivers and lakes " ( 67 ) . Although all the geography textbooks I reviewed noted many geographical areas of the world , each began with and emphasized the New England states . Morse ( 1804,96 ) noted that New Englanders speak English " with great purity , " whereas in the middle and southern states , the language " is corrupted " because of " the great influx of foreigners . " <p> A second theme dealing with self and citizenship was the matter of personal control or duty , which was often termed self-government . Many educators believed that for such a large republic to survive every U.S. citizen had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was often repeated in early textbooks and speeches concerning education . To achieve communal harmony , discord in the form of personal extremes or excess could not be tolerated . Bingham ( 1815 ) , in American Preceptor , for instance , compares American society to a heap of glowing embers , " when placed asunder , can retain neither their light or heat . . . but when brought together . . . give heat and light to each other " ( 172 ) . Readings in The American Preceptor urge moderation and personal obligation : Sensual excesses . . . debase , corrupt and brutalize . . . moderation is essential to true pleasure ( 20 ) . Blessed is that nation whose sons and daughters are trained to virtue , honor and usefulness " ( 49 ) . " The way to wealth . . . depends chiefly on two words , industry and frugality ; that is waste neither time nor money , but make the best use of both " ( 73 ) . In a discussion of female education , Bingham noted , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the world conspiring can not make a woman happy who does not govern her passion " ( 91-92 ) . In a piece called " A Short System of Virtue and Happiness , " Bingham showed how individual governance was connected to the governance of society : <p> My duty to myself is , indeed , intimately , connected with my duty to others . By preserving the faculties of my mind and my body , and by improving them to the utmost , I am enabled to exert them with effect to the service of society . I am connected with others by the ties of consanguinity and friendship , and by the common bond of partaking in the same humanity . ( 21 ) <p> Historian Hannah Adams ( 1805 , 16 ) noted in her History of New England that " education and early habits form the great outline of human character . . . . It is the command of heaven , that we use every exertion to improve the talents which our great Creator has afforded us . " She believed that America 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could model their own behavior : <p> Let us of the present age be instructed by our ancestors ' example , to guard against the prejudices of ignorance , and under their wise institutions , improved as they have been by succeeding generations , let us be careful to acquire a competent fund of information for the correct discharge of the duties of our respective situations in society . ( 58 ) <p> Bentley ( 1825 ) also emphasized similar themes of self-government : " It is of utmost importance that we rule our own tongues " ( 102 ) . " Happy is that man . . . who is master of himself , his time and his fortune " ( 137 ) . " Have arms for your defense , but have none for offence " ( 199 ) . Webster ( 1814,63 ) , quoting Dr. Belnap 's address concerning self-government in education , noted that good instructors " must teach by their example as well as their precepts ; that they must govern themselves , and teach their students the art of self-government . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in early U.S. textbooks was the inclusion of local and recent history . The topics dominate early nineteenth century geography , reading , and history books . Educators connected the past to the present in a variety of clever and interesting ways . The revolution was only several generations old , but many of America 's school-aged citizens had not been actively involved . Educators wanted young people to understand the sacrifices and courage of their fathers and grandfathers . " Honorable age is not that which standeth in length of time , nor which is measured by numbers of years , " said Webster ( 1814,106 ) . Adams ( 1805 ) noted , " Americans have raised their character to a level with that of the bravest people recorded in history " ( 99 ) . " Their judgment in forming their policy . . . was consistent with the best , greatest , and wisest legislators of antiquity " ( 27 ) . <p> Histories , geography texts , and readers often blurred time periods by connecting past events to present-day occasions . Authors sometimes included a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short past . Sometimes they would juxtapose a great speech from antiquity as part of both events . At other times an author would stay with one theme by using a variety of literary material from several time periods . <p> In his 1814 textbook , Webster included a " current " speech of elderly Boston Congressman Ames advocating the passage of a treaty between America and Great Britain ( 153-61 ) . Just before that selection , the author included the " Declaration by the representatives of the United Colonies of North America setting forth the causes and necessity of their taking up Arms against Great Britain , July 6th , 1775 " ( 146-53 ) . Right after the Ames speech , Webster inserted a speech by Cicero in which he castigated Verres for pleading immunity from Roman punishment merely because he was a wealthy citizen of the state ( 161-64 ) . <p> Pierpont ( 1829 ) also blurred time periods . For example , he included an account of the landing at Plymouth in 1620 by Robertson and Neal ( 196 ) , which is followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that this grand industry was accomplished on the spot where we dwell " ( 200 ) . Next Pierpont included a variety of commemorative poems about the Pilgrims and ended the segment with a narrative , the " Character of the Puritan " ( 213 ) . Later , Pierpont used the theme of the beginning of the Revolution to gather Patrick Henry 's speech ( 221 ) , William Pitt 's speech to the British Parliament ( 219 ) , an account of the attack on Lexington and Concord by Botta ( 223 ) , and an early nineteenth century oration delivered at Concord , in which the speaker states : " This is a proud anniversary for our neighborhood " ( 229 ) . Pierpont ended that segment with several poems commemorating Concord and Bunker Hill . For the final selection of his reader , Pierpont connected the past to the present by including a speech by Daniel Webster delivered on August 2 , 1826 , at Boston 's Faneuil Hall ( 260-61 ) . The speech describes the common lives of John Adams and Thomas Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on July 4 , 1826 . <p> The authors of all the textbooks I examined emphasized the contemporary celebration of the Fourth of July along with the original eighteenth century event . Bentley ( 1825 ) , for instance , took a backward look : <p> Still do their sons retrace with proud delight the record of their fathers ' noble deeds . . . . Although most of the sages and heroes of the Revolution have yielded to the law of nature , . . . yet their mantle still rests on their sons . . . . The enthusiasm with which the return of this day is hailed , is a pledge to the spirit of seventy-six . . . . Let the youth grow up amidst annual festivals , commemorative of the events of war ; . . . let his first study be of your declaration of independence and the code of the constitution . ( 198-99 ) <p> Bingham ( 1815 ) uses a Fourth of July oration that John Quincy Adams delivered in 1793 , when he noted that " millions of hearts which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been translated to brighter worlds . " Adams directed his words to those who were too young " to partake of the divine enthusiasm which inspired the American bosom " and hoped that if a time for fighting should again arise , the new generation would live up to those of the past and be " faithful disciples " ( 142-45 ) . <p> In nineteenth century geography books , July 4 , 1776 , was a date that marked a changed geographical description of the United States . In Universal Geography , Morse ( 1804,97 ) described what is now the eastern seaboard of the United States as a possession of Great Britain until July 4 , 1776 , and Goldsmith ( 1811 , 11 ) explained that before the Fourth of July , the area was " denominated the American Colonies " <p> Another method of using local history and connecting the then and now was to talk at length about America 's " natural curiosities . " Pierpont ( 1829 ) noted in his reader how the British <p> sneer at our country because it has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . nothing to connect the imagination . . . with the past ; no recollections of former ages , to associate the past with the future . . . . I can not judge of the recollections excited by castles and towers that I have not seen . But I have seen . . . those lonely tombs of the desert -- seen them rise from their boundless and unpeopled plains . My imagination and my heart have been full of the past . ( 44-45 ) <p> Early history , geography , and reading books discussed America 's natural wonders as a means of connecting the past to the present . All textbooks describe Niagara Falls from a variety of time perspectives . Bingham ( 1815 ) discussed how time and " the great quantity of water " had worn away the stone " for about seven miles up towards Lake Erie , and a chasm is formed which no person can approach without horror " ( 170 ) . Pierpont ( 1829 ) noted , " When the admirer of nature 's wonders visits Niagara , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these woods during many centuries , as the foam of the cataract has risen daily , to fall again , and to be swept away " ( 99 ) . Morse ( 1816 ) wrote that the Indians never pass the falls " without offering a sacrifice of tobacco to the spirit of the water " ( 64 ) . Conclusions and Areas for Further Study <p> Educators recognize the importance of individual empowerment as a condition of democratic life . That empowerment must begin early in a child 's education . Young citizens become empowered by discovering relationships between their own personal environment and the past , present , and future environments of the external world . Regardless of time and place , uncovering one 's personal and local identity connects a student to his or her past as well as present . Such connections not only make history more relevant and meaningful but also allow students to understand their particular place in society . <p> This research shows the insight of our nation 's first generation of educators , who understood the importance of studying the familiar through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important part of America 's citizenship curriculum throughout its educational history . Many early educators rejected traditional content to connect the here and now to the development of democratic citizens . They accomplished that task through the creation of original textbooks in the areas of reading , history , and geography . Very little is known about the motives , strategies , and background of those authors , but we do know that instead of emphasizing unrelated facts and ideas , they carefully identified and implemented three important citizenship themes : communication skills , self-government , and local history . All wrote popular textbooks that were used in hundreds of New England schools and elsewhere to educate the world 's first generation of a modern democracy . Researchers today need to understand the motives and assumptions of the first U.S. educators . That information might help the emerging educational systems of newly created democratic nations to create their own personal and local social studies curriculum . <p> Studying early American educators may also help current and future U.S. students to understand their roles and responsibilities in today 's increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ethnocentric tradition in the teaching of American social studies , it does foster interest and citizenship understanding for a variety of age groups . Perhaps elements of the Expanding Environments curriculum should be as common in middle and secondary social studies curriculums as it is in the curriculum of elementary school . <p> Key words : citizenship education , early American education , nineteenth century education , studying local history and geography <p>
